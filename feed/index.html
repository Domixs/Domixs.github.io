										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LITHIUM LICENSE IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>Lithium mining is a growing industry in Nigeria, and the government has recently issued permits to allow companies to begin mining operations. The Nigerian government has identified lithium as a strategic mineral and is keen to develop the industry in order to benefit from its potential economic benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exploration for Lithium in Nigeria</strong></p>
<p>Exploration for lithium in Nigeria is still in the early stages. The Nigerian Geological Survey Agency (NGSA) is the government agency responsible for mineral exploration and mapping in the country. The NGSA has conducted several surveys in the Jos Plateau and has identified areas that are likely to contain lithium.</p>
<p>In 2018, a Nigerian mining company, Kian Smith Trade &amp; Co, announced that it had discovered lithium in commercial quantities in the country. The company stated that it had found 15,000 tonnes of lithium ore in the central part of Nigeria. This discovery has raised interest in lithium exploration in Nigeria and has attracted the attention of international mining companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types of Permits/Licenses for Lithium in Nigeria</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mining Permit:</strong> The Nigerian government has issued Small Scale Mining Leases to a few companies to begin lithium mining operations in the country. These permits are issued by the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development and are valid for a period of five years. The permits allow companies to explore and develop lithium deposits, as well as to extract and process the mineral.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Possess &amp; Purchase License</strong>: Possess &amp; Purchase License is issued to companies that are not willing to commence the mining process immediately, but rather purchase from mining companies, either for processing or immediate export. The Possess &amp; Purchase License is also issued by the Ministry of Mines Steel Development. It is renewable annually. Some of the key requirements to obtain this license include CAC Incorporation Documents; a Tax Clearance Certificate; an Attestation of Non-conviction from a Legal Practitioner; a Bank Reference Letter; Consent of a Mining Permit Holder among others.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mineral Buying Center</strong>: Mineral Buying Centre License is also similar to that of Possess &amp; Purchase License, save for it includes additional requirements such as Warehouse and Environmental Impact Assessment Report. The License permits a company to buy and store lithium in a particular location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mineral EXport Permit</strong>: The mineral Export Permit is in favour of a company ready to export minerals out of Nigeria. For a company to be eligible for this permit, such a company must have lithium that has been acquired or prepared for export and royalties must have been paid to the government on such minerals. The Export Permit is issued only on available minerals and it is issued by the same Ministry of Mines and Steel Development. A mineral Export Permit is a key requirement to export lithium out of Nigeria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nigerian government has also in place a number of regulations to ensure that the mining operations are conducted in a safe and responsible manner. These regulations include environmental protection measures, such as the requirement for companies to conduct environmental impact assessments before beginning operations. Companies must also adhere to safety standards and must ensure that their operations do not cause any harm to the environment or local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, the Nigerian government has also put in place a number of incentives to encourage companies to invest in the lithium mining industry. These incentives include tax breaks and other forms of support.</p>
<p>It is important to further emphasis that any foreign company seeking to engage in mining or buying of lithium or other mineral resources in Nigeria must first incorporate a local company in Nigeria. Under the Nigerian company law, every foreigner seeking to engage in business activities in Nigeria must incorporate a local entity; a foreign company is prohibited from engaging in any business activities in Nigeria without registering locally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Finally, the Nigerian government is committed to developing the lithium mining industry in the country and is keen to ensure that the industry is conducted in a safe and responsible manner. The issuance of permits to companies to begin mining operations or trading of lithium is an important step in this process and is likely to lead to increased investment in the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> FCCPC REGISTRATION FOR DIGITAL LENDING COMPANIES</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) is the regulatory authority responsible for, among other things, the administration and enforcement of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2018 (the Act).  Recently the FCCPC, NITDA (National Information Technology Development Agency) together with other federal agencies have been looking into the activities of digital lending companies in Nigeria pertaining to infringements of the privacy of their customers and shaming of their debtors.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://fccpc.gov.ng/">FCCPC</a> first issued orders to multiple financial institutions freezing or suspending operations of certain accounts, which some of the money lenders have used to conduct business transactions subject to investigation.</p>
<p>The FCCPC has now laid down interim guidelines and regulations to regulate digital money lending organizations, which include that every Digital Lending organization now has to register with the FCCPC.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements for FCCPC Registration for Digital Lending Companies</strong></p>
<p>The following are the requirements for registration with the FCCPC by digital lending companies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Certified copy of the certificate of incorporation of the applicant.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A brief description of the business of the applicant and where relevant, their groups.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Organogram showing role players and location of key role players and any operational approving authorities/person.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Name and address of a person within the business who is authorized to accept all correspondence and accept service on behalf of the business.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Evidence of membership in any trade or professional associates.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Any service level agreements with any service providers with respect to the operation but excluding administration.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Evidence of feedback and complaint resolution mechanism.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Terms of use of the business of the applicant.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Privacy policy of the applicant.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Evidence of data auditing compliance and data auditing report submitted to the Nigerian Data Protection Bureau</strong></li>
<li><strong>Evidence of tax payments or tax waivers where applicable.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Money lending license.</strong></li>
<li><strong>All applicable fees associated with service.</strong></li>
<li><strong>FCCPC INTERIM DIGITAL LENDING GUIDELINES FORM 002 – a declaration for Digital Lending Businesses in Nigeria.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is worthy of note that the obligation to comply with the FCCPC regulations &amp;guidelines is mandatory before any digital lending company can operate in Nigeria. A lending company found dodging or circumventing the FCCPC guidelines may be restricted from carrying on business operations in Nigeria apart from the likely prosecution of the director(s) of such a company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Money laundering is the process of concealing the origin of money, obtained from illicit activities such as drug trafficking, corruption, and embezzlement by converting it into a legitimate source. It is a crime in many jurisdictions with varying definitions. It is usually a key operation of organized crime.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, the Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act of 2022 was passed into Law in the month of May 2022 to set standards and promote the effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering. The new Act has made an improvement on the earlier Act of 2011.</p>
<p>In this write-up, we shall briefly discuss the relevant provisions of the new Act below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Limit</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Section 2 of the Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022 provides;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>(1) No person or body corporate shall, except in a transaction through a financial institution, make or accept cash payment of a sum exceeding— </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(a) N5,000,000 or its equivalent, in the case of an individual; or </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(b) N10,000,000 or its equivalent, in the case of a body corporate. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(2) A person shall not conduct two or more transactions separately with one or more financial institutions or designated non-financial businesses and professions with intent to— </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(a) avoid the duty to report a transaction which should be reported under this Act; and </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(b) breach the duty to disclose information under this act by any other means. </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li> As seen from the provision above, the cash limit permissible for an individual to make or accept is the sum of N5,000,000(Five Million Naira) or its equivalent and N10,000,000(Ten Million Naira) or its equivalent in the case of a body corporate. Such transactions are to be routed through a financial institution, and any lodgment of funds in excess of N5,000,000 (Five Million Naira) and N10,000,000(Ten Million Naira) for individuals and body corporate respectively, must be reported by the banks within seven days.</li>
<li><strong>Splits</strong>: Subsection 2 above prohibits a situation where a person splits a single transaction into two or more separate transactions with the intent to avoid the reporting of such transaction.</li>
<li>Section 3 of the Act provides that the international transfer of funds or securities to or from a foreign country exceeding $10,000(Ten Thousand Dollars) is to be reported within one day of the transaction. Funds refer to assets of every kind whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, howsoever acquired and legal documents or instruments in any form, including electronic or digital, evidencing title to or interest in such assets, including bank credits, travellers’ cheques, bank cheques, money orders, shares, securities, bonds, drafts or letters of credit and virtual assets. Virtual assets, on the other hand, mean a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or investment purposes but do not include digital representations of fiat currencies, securities and other financial assets.</li>
<li><strong>Know Your Customer (KYC):</strong> For the purpose of carrying out the purport of this law, in Section 4 of the Act, financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions must conduct due diligence and identification of their customers particularly persons alleging to act on behalf of its customers. Designated non-financial businesses and professions include (a) automotive dealers, (b) businesses involved in the hospitality industry, (c) casinos, (d) clearing and settlement companies, (e) consultants and consulting companies, (f ) dealers in jewelries, (g) dealers in mechanised farming equipment, farming equipment and machineries, (h) dealers in precious metals and precious stones, (i) dealers in real estate, estate developers, estate agents and brokers (j) high value dealers, (k) hotels, (l) legal practitioners and notaries, (m) licensed professional accountants, (n) mortgage brokers, (o) practitioners of mechanised farming, (p) supermarkets, (q) tax consultants, (r) trust and company service providers, (s) pools betting, or (t) such other businesses and professions as may be designated by the Minister responsible for Trade and Investment.</li>
<li>The law provides for 24-hour timeframes for all financial institutions or designates non-financial institutions to file suspicious transaction reports with the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) which is the central unit responsible for receiving, requesting, analyzing and disseminating to the competent authorities disclosures of financial information concerning the suspected proceeds of crime and potential financing of terrorism. With regards to this reporting, section 7 provides thus:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Where a transaction— (a) involves a frequency which is unjustifiable or unreasonable, (b) is surrounded by conditions of unusual or unjustified complexity, (c) appears to have no economic justification or lawful objective, (d) is inconsistent with the known transaction pattern of the account or business relationship, or (e) in the opinion of the financial institution or non-financial business and profession involves the proceeds of a criminal activity, unlawful act, money laundering or terrorist financing, that transaction shall be deemed to be suspicious and the financial institution and designated non-financial business and profession involved in the transaction shall report to the Unit as the case may be immediately. (2) A financial institution or designated non-financial business and profession shall within 24 hours after the transaction referred to in subsection (1).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Act further spells out the punishment for failure to report and/or make a disclosure of acts of money laundering. Section 11 of the Act provides that any financial institution or designated non-financial business and profession that contravenes the provisions commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of at least N250,000 and not more than N1,000,000 for each day the contravention continues. Also, Legal professional privilege and the invocation of client confidentiality shall not apply in connection with— (a) the purchase or sale of property; (b) the purchase or sale of any business; (c) the managing of client money, securities or other assets; (d) the opening or management of bank, savings or securities accounts; (d) the creation, operation or management of trusts, companies or similar structures; or (e) anything produced in furtherance of any unlawful act.</li>
<li>The law prohibits the opening or maintaining of numbered or anonymous accounts by any person, financial institution or body corporate. The operation of and establishment of a shell bank in Nigeria is also prohibited. A shell bank means a bank that is not physically located in the country in which it is incorporated and licensed, and which is unaffiliated with a regulated financial group that is subject to effective consolidated supervision. Any person, financial institution or body corporate that contravenes the provisions commits an offence and is liable to conviction to, in the case of an individual, a term of imprisonment of at least two years but not more than five years or in the case of a financial institution or body corporate, a fine of at least N10,000,000 but not more than N50,000,000, in addition, there shall be the prosecution of the principal officers of the body corporate and the winding up and prohibition of its constitution or incorporation under any form or guise.</li>
<li>Furthermore, financial institutions and non-designated financial businesses and professions must create mechanisms for determining whether a customer or a customer’s beneficiary is a politically exposed person. The Act defines politically exposed persons to include (a) individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example Heads of State or Government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of State-owned corporations and important political party officials, (b) individuals who are or have been entrusted domestically with prominent public functions, for example Heads of State or of Government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of State-owned corporations and important political party officials, and (c) persons who are or have been entrusted with a prominent function by an international organisation and includes members of senior management such as directors, deputy directors and members of the board or equivalent functions and their family members and close associates, other than middle ranking or more junior individuals in the foregoing categories.</li>
<li><strong>Registration with SCUML:</strong> The new Act makes it mandatory for all non-designated financial institutions to register with the SCUML and make various statutory reports as provided by the Act.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>CONCLUSION </u></strong></p>
<p>Conclusively, the new Act seeks to remedy the lacuna that the former Act created. Based on the key provisions above, an individual and body corporate who makes or accepts transactions exceeding the amount stipulated in the Act commits an offence and is liable to punishment as prescribed.</p>
<p>The Act further seeks to put financial institutions on their feet in the discharge of their duties by placing a timeframe within which to report any suspicious transactions and failure to do so attracts a penalty as discussed above.</p>
<p>It suffices to say that the new Act does not encourage lackadaisical attitudes from persons or corporate bodies involved in any financial transaction.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Business Permits and other necessary licenses must be obtained by any foreign-owned company for a seamless business operation in Nigeria. In addition to obtaining a business permit, any foreigner wishing to work as an employee or control a company in Nigeria must also obtain an Expatriate Quota through the company for that purpose.</p>
<p>Both the Business Permit and Expatriate Quota are issued by the Federal Ministry of Interiors with the aims and objectives of regulating foreign investments and migrations into Nigeria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS PERMIT </strong></p>
<p>A business Permit is a document that allows foreigners to conduct business in Nigeria. It is usually issued by the Federal Ministry of Interior on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria. If a company is wholly owned by a foreigner(s), the business permit must be obtained from the ministry before the company commences business operation.</p>
<p><strong>Section 36(1)(a) and (b) of the Immigration Act (2015),</strong> and <strong>Paragraph 4 of the Immigration Regulations (2017) </strong>provides that no person other than a Nigerian citizen shall, on his own account or in partnership with any other person, practice a profession or establish or take over any trade or business whatsoever or register or take over any company with limited liability for any purpose without the written consent of the Minister of Internal Affairs”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EXPATRIATE QUOTA</strong></p>
<p>Expatriate Quota is a document that allows foreigners to work and live in Nigeria freely. The Expatriate Quota is processed by a company looking to hire foreigners to work and live in Nigeria. The expatriate quota is also applicable to any foreigner who is a director or an owner of a registered business in Nigeria and is willing to obtain residency status in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Expatriate quota is also issued by the Federal Ministry of Interior on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria.</p>
<p>The Federal Ministry of the Interior currently allocates a three-year quota for expatriates. A renewal application can be submitted after the quota has expired.</p>
<p>After a successful application for Expatriate Quota, the company can proceed to process a Subject to Regularization (STR) Visa for its expatriates. This will give the foreigner the opportunity to process and obtain the Combined Expatriate Residence Permit and Aliens Card (CERPAC) that allows them to live and work in Nigeria.</p>
<p><strong>Section 36(1)(a) and (b) of the Immigration Act, 2015</strong> provides that a foreigner granted a business permit must be able to fit into the Expatriate Quota.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING A BUSINESS PERMIT IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>The requirements for obtaining a business permit in Nigeria include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The certificate of incorporation of the applicant’s company</li>
<li>Tax Clearance Certificate</li>
<li>Memorandum and Articles of Association</li>
<li>The CAC Application status</li>
<li>The shareholding of the company.</li>
<li>Joint venture agreement</li>
<li>Approval from all appropriate professional bodies. This approval depends on the type of business being carried out by the company.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING AN EXPATRIATE QUOTA IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>The requirements for the grant of an expatriate quota include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duly completed registration form</li>
<li>Incorporation documents, which include a Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles of Association, Application Status including the particulars of the directors of the company</li>
<li>Feasibility report to be registered with CAC</li>
<li>Certified current audited account and bank reference letter</li>
<li>Annual income tax clearance certificate of each expatriate staff</li>
<li>Proposed annual salary to be paid to the expatriate worker indicating their designation, names, and duration of employment</li>
<li>Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) for partnership ventures between Nigerians and foreigners</li>
<li>Company’s Tax Clearance Certificate</li>
<li>Lease agreement or C of O for operating premises</li>
<li>Particular of training programs for Nigerians</li>
<li>List of Nigerians working in the company to understudy the expatriates</li>
<li>License permit from government agencies where the company engage in specialized sectors such as the oil and gas sector, telecommunications, health, etc</li>
<li>Certificate of capital importation where Applicant wants to import capital into the country</li>
<li>Business Permit</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, the approval of the grant of Expatriate Quota has been simplified so as not to overburden investors who are willing to come to invest in Nigeria. The government has ensured that foreign directors or owners of businesses can obtain expatriate quotas easily. In practice, foreign-owned companies often process business permits together with expatriate quotas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NHF CONTRIBUTIONS SCHEME IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>National Housing Funding (NHF) is a Federal Government scheme that entitles Nigerians in paid employment and above 21 years to cater to their housing needs. This scheme was established by the virtue of the NHF Act of 1992.</p>
<p>According to the NHF Act, all Nigerian employees and income earners, whether in paid employment or self-employment, are entitled to the NHF scheme and can register as long as they are 21 years of age. The Act also outlines that registered members should contribute about 2.5% of their basic monthly salary to the Fund through the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN).</p>
<h4><strong>Is NHF compulsory? </strong></h4>
<p>As per the provisions in the NHF Act, all Nigerians in paid employment are obligated to contribute 2.5% of their monthly salary to the National House Fund. Consequently, an employer must deduct 2.5% of the basic salary from the employees and remit it to the FMBN monthly.</p>
<h4><strong>What are the benefits of the NHF scheme? </strong></h4>
<p>The main goal of the NHF scheme is the allocation of funds for the provision of affordable housing for Nigerians. Primarily, it allows a contributor to access a loan for the building, purchasing, or renovation loan for residential accommodation.</p>
<p>Among other benefits a contributor enjoys from the NHF scheme include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced tax liability because contributions to the NHF are tax-deductible</li>
<li>Housing loan of up to 90% of the cost of the house.</li>
<li>Interest on loans remains fixed throughout the life of the mortgage at 6% p.a.</li>
<li>The long period of repayment of up to 30 years.</li>
<li>Contributions can serve as additional old age security.</li>
<li>Up to N15 million can be borrowed.</li>
<li>Refunds with 2% interest on retirement.</li>
<li>Every contributor has a lifetime registration number, a passbook for the personal recording of contributions and an account statement.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the penalty for not contributing to NHF? </strong></h4>
<p><strong>Section 20</strong> of the Act stipulates that Punishments vary depending on the party, as outlined below:</p>
<ol>
<li>A person who prevents or obstructs deduction or remittance of the contribution is guilty under Sec 20 of the Act, guilty of an offence, and liable to a fine of N5, 000 or one-year imprisonment.</li>
<li>An employer who fails to make deductions from his employees&#8217; salaries for NHF contribution or fails to remit the money deducted is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of N50, 000. Also, the individual staff of the employer responsible for making a deduction or remit deduction is exposed to a fine of N20, 000 or imprisonment for five years term or both such fine and imprisonment.</li>
<li>A self-employed person who fails to make a deduction and fails to remit to the bank money for the NHF is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of N5 000 or one-year imprisonment, or both.</li>
</ol>
<p>The institution of proceedings or imposition of a penalty under this section shall not relieve any employer or self-employed person from liability to pay to the bank the money deducted by him for the purpose of the Fund.</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE FOR REGISTRATION WITH NHF</strong></p>
<p>All Nigerians in employment, whether self-employed or in paid employment, are required by the NHF Act to contribute 2.5% of their basic salary/income to the fund. The procedure for registration is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) will supply Employer Registration       Form (NHF1) to employers.</li>
<li>Employers will complete form NHF1 and return to the nearest branch of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria will register the Employer and issue an employer’s registration number.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria will issue form NHF2 to employers for completion by employees or directly to self-employed or individuals.</li>
<li>An employee will complete the form NHF2 and return it to the employer.</li>
<li>The employer or self-employed individuals will return the completed form (NHF2) to the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria will register Employees on Form NHF2 and allocate employees&#8217; participation numbers to each employee/self-employed individual.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank will issue a passbook to each of the registered employees where the monthly deduction of his/her 2.5% basic salary will be posted by the employer.</li>
<li>At this point, an employee is now a registered participant of the National Housing Fund.</li>
<li>Employer will commence the deduction of contributions at source. Such deductions/contributions are remitted to the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria with a schedule of payment indicating the amount contributed by each employee and the period covered.</li>
<li>Self–employed contributors will also commence monthly remittances of contributions to FMBN.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria will accept contributions and issue receipts for payments.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How does one apply for an NHF loan? </strong></h4>
<p>First, the applicant must meet the eligibility requirements on the loan application form, including registering with the NHF scheme. The applicant must be someone who contributed to the Fund at least six months before applying for the loan. Unlike institutional borrowers, individuals cannot apply directly from the FMBN but through a duly licensed and accredited Primary Mortgage Institution (PMI) of their choice. The PMI then forwards the application to the FMBN.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>At its inception, the major goal of NHF was affordable housing to accommodate the Nigerian populace in a suitable environment as the performance of the housing sector is one of the yardsticks for measuring the health of a nation.</p>
<p>Nigeria’s property market faces a paucity of funds, thus a law that mandates every employee to contribute a part of their earnings towards owning a home is important.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, the demand for affordable and befitting housing for citizens far outweighs its supply. NHF, therefore, serves as a contribution towards acquiring an asset, in this case, a home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most times individuals in Nigeria or even outside of Nigeria may need to obtain a police character certificate for different reasons or purposes. However, the most common reason for obtaining a police character certificate is for immigration or travel purpose. In this article, we would briefly discuss the Police Character Certificate in Nigeria and the procedures for obtaining the same.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS A POLICE CHARACTER CERTIFICATE?</strong></p>
<p>Police Character Certificate (PCC) which is also called Police Clearance Report or Certificate is a certificate issued to individuals who live in Nigeria for a period of time to clarify that such person has no criminal records in Nigeria.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy, that for a foreigner to be eligible to apply for the police character certificate, the foreigner must have lived in Nigeria for a period of <strong>at least thirty (30) days.</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHO ISSUES THE POLICE CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE?</strong></p>
<p>The Police Clearance Certificate is issued by the Nigerian Police Force, usually at the Force Criminal Investigation Department, Police Criminal Registry, and in any Nigerian Police Criminal Registry in the 36 states.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO APPLY FOR A POLICE CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE?</strong></p>
<p>For an applicant to be able to apply for the PCC, the following requirement are needed to be present at the application and collection office in Nigeria.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> A valid International Passport (that in the bio-data page).</strong></li>
<li><strong> Two passport-size photographs.</strong></li>
<li><strong> An application fee (this varies from state to state).</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE FOR APPLICATION OF POLICE CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE</strong></p>
<p>If the applicant is in Nigeria, such an applicant can apply in person at the Police Central Criminal Registry in Lagos or any state the person is currently located.</p>
<p>The applicant will pay some application fees and collect the application form which would be filled either with blue or black ink and attach the passport photograph.</p>
<p>For the column that requires the applicant&#8217;s fingerprints, the officer in charge would guide the applicant on how to impute the applicant’s fingerprints, which include the five right fingers and the five left fingers.</p>
<p>After filling the form correctly, one shall submit it along with a copy of the international passport bio-data page to the officer in charge and then wait for the certificate to be processed.</p>
<p>After the forensic officer has analyzed and run a full background check on the applicant’s fingerprints and details, the certificate would be processed and issued accordingly.</p>
<p>The applicant must duly complete the application form, which will include the fingerprints of such applicants. The Nigerian Police Authorities will ensure that the fingerprints and all details provided by the applicant are duly queried or searched in their database to determine whether the applicant has a criminal record or not or before the certificate is issued.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LAWS OF DIVORCE IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>Divorce is a legal means of bringing a statutory marriage to an end through the court system and for a marriage to undergo divorce proceedings in the High Court, such marriage must be one of those governed by the Matrimonial Causes Act LFN 2004 (the Act), such as marriages conducted in a licensed place of worship, a registrar’s office and marriage under special license and evidenced by a valid Marriage Certificate.</p>
<p>The Matrimonial Causes Act LFN 2004 (S.11) directs the court not to grant divorce petitions quickly and instead to encourage couples to try reconciliation. The law also requires the court to first act as a conciliator, attempting to reconcile the marriage.</p>
<p><strong>WHICH COURT HAS THE JURISDICTION TO DETERMINE THE DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE?</strong></p>
<p>Any High Court of any State of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory has jurisdiction to determine a petition for dissolution of marriage. Thus, no matter which state where the marriage is conducted, jurisdiction is nationwide and divorce proceedings can be commenced in any state. Furthermore, for a court to have jurisdiction over a petition for dissolution of marriage, one of the parties must be a Nigerian citizen (not overseas) or have a domicile in Nigeria. For the purposes of domicile, Nigeria is treated as a single federation entity. As a result, a person who is domiciled in any state of the Federation is regarded to be domiciled in Nigeria and can file a divorce petition in any state in the country, regardless of whether he or she is domiciled there or elsewhere.</p>
<p>The court has the authority to transfer a divorce case filed in a State High Court to any other State High Court in the Federation under the rule of &#8220;forum convenience,&#8221; particularly if it is in the interests of justice to have the case heard in the other State or if the other party has no objection.</p>
<p><strong>GROUNDS</strong> <strong>FOR</strong> <strong>DIVORCE</strong> <strong>IN</strong> <strong>NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>The primary ground for divorce in Nigeria is that <strong>the marriage has broken down irretrievably</strong>. This is the provision of s.15 of the Matrimonial Cause Act LFN 2004.</p>
<p>The expression &#8220;broken down irretrievably&#8221; suggests that there is nothing that can be done to make the marriage work again, and divorce is the only option.</p>
<p>Flowing from that singular ground, the Act in section 15(2) specifies the reasons why a marriage would be considered to have broken down irretrievably as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a partner is unfaithful, and the other partner cannot tolerate the extramarital affairs can be a reason for divorce.</li>
<li>When a partner is denying the other partner sex or lovemaking or when one partner due to mental or health conditions cannot grant sex or sexually satisfy the other partner can be a valid ground for divorce. This is called the inability to consummate the marriage.</li>
<li>When a partner exhibits a character that is annoying to the other partner that the other partner can no longer tolerate, the habit can be a valid reason for a partner to file for divorce. For instance, a wife can file for divorce on the grounds that the man is a serial drunkard.</li>
<li>When a partner has deserted the marriage or left the other partner and becomes incommunicado for up to a year is a reason to seek divorce.</li>
<li>When the couples have separated and been living apart for a period of two years and none of them objects to the dissolution of marriage being granted by the court.</li>
<li>When both couples have separated and been living apart for a period of three years. If a divorce is predicated on this reason, the court has no other discretion to exercise than to grant the divorce. See the case of <strong><em>Omotunde v. Omotunde (2001) 9 NWLR (pt. 718) 525.</em></strong></li>
<li>When the other party has for a period of not less than a year failed to comply with the order of the court to resume cohabitation and restitution on the conjugal right (having sexual intercourse again).</li>
<li>When one of the couples has been missing for at least seven years, which is enough for him or her to be presumed to have been dead.</li>
</ul>
<p>When any of the reasons above is why a partner is seeking a divorce, it must be established that it leads to the primary ground which is that it made the marriage to have broken irretrievably.</p>
<p>Also, courts will be hesitant to grant partners divorce for a marriage that is less than two years, this is called the two years rule. The exception to this Two-Years Rule by virtue of section 30 (2) MCA applies as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>where the respondent has willfully and persistently refused to consummate the marriage;</li>
<li>that since the marriage the Respondent has committed adultery and the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent;</li>
<li>since the marriage, the respondent has committed rape, sodomy, or bestiality;</li>
<li>proceedings for a decree of dissolution of marriage by way of cross-proceedings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The law according to Section 30 of the Act provides that it is only with the leave (permission) of the court that a proceeding for divorce and separation of marriage that is less than two years can be commenced.</p>
<p>The Court will issue an order for a decree nisi if any or all of the foregoing are proven. A nisi order is a temporary order that separates the marriage. In the absence of any appeal by the affected party, the order automatically becomes absolute (i.e. permanent) after three (3) months. When the Court issues an absolute decree, the marriage is entirely dissolved.</p>
<p>Neither party has the right to challenge the High Court&#8217;s decision if the decree nisi has become absolute and one of the parties dies before the three (3) month period has passed.</p>
<p>However, a Petitioner in a suit for dissolution of marriage may not succeed in getting a divorce order if he/she has condoned any of the facts provided for under Section 15 (2) of the Act already discussed above.</p>
<p>The dissolution of a statutory marriage has the effect of allowing any of the parties to marry again. When a judge deems a marriage dissolved, the parties are legally free and single, as free as birds to mix and enter another marriage if they so desire.</p>
<p>In conclusion, every marriage is unique, and each has its own set of unique facts about which couples should seek legal advice and guidance while contemplating a dissolution of such a marriage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) of Nigeria has recently released new rules regarding the issuance, exchange and custody of digital assets (i.e digital token that represents assets such as debt or equity claim on the issuer) in Nigeria. Digital assets here refer to all types of crypto assets.</p>
<p>The rules shall apply to all issuers seeking to raise capital through digital asset offerings.</p>
<p>The new rules for digital assets are part of the SEC&#8217;s effort to regulate digital assets such as BITCOINS and NFTs.</p>
<p>The new rules cover the issuance of digital assets as securities, the registration of platforms and digital asset custodians, exchanges and virtual assets service providers.</p>
<p>In 2020, CBN directed financial service providers to halt cryptocurrency transactions, but SEC&#8217;s new regulations mandate the registration of the offering and sale of digital tokens that are considered securities.</p>
<p>It is crucial that SEC tackles the growing cases of crypto scams and dubious entities taking advantage of Nigerian investors in the crypto market. The crypto market is volatile, so this new regulation on the National level may bring about structure and stability to the market.</p>
<p>The new SEC&#8217;s regulations cover 5 major items ranging from issuance of digital assets to rules that govern digital asset exchanges in the country.</p>
<p>In the new guidelines, SEC requires crypto issuers or sponsors to register their digital assets with the commission. The issuers are also required to make an initial assessment filing with it to prove that the assets they issue are securities, followed by filing for proper registration.</p>
<p>According to the new guidelines, those that have already issued assets or engaged in “Initial Coin Offering (ICO) will be given 3 months to comply with the stated registration requirements.”</p>
<p>Every individual or corporate organization which engages in any aspect of Blockchain-related and digital asset services must register with the SEC and follow its regulatory guidelines.</p>
<p>The Regulations provide that: “Such services include, but are not limited to reception, transmission and execution of orders on behalf of other persons, dealers on own account, portfolio management, investment advice, custodian or nominee services.”.</p>
<p>SEC stated that it might require foreign or non-resident startups or companies to establish a branch in Nigeria, adding that foreign entities will be recognized if they belong to a country that either has a reciprocal agreement with Nigeria or is a member of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).</p>
<p>With the new guidelines, SEC mandates entities seeking to offer any kind of crypto products and services in Nigeria or to Nigerians to secure a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license.</p>
<p>This is besides relevant category licenses, implying that an exchange would need a digital asset exchange license in addition to the VASP permit.</p>
<p>The VASP license has underlining obligations, including a requirement that license holders should obtain self-declared risk acknowledgement forms from users while also issuing a disclaimer that losses from investments are not covered by any protection fund.</p>
<p>VASPs are also required to employ anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards.</p>
<p>Apart from the VASP rules, the new SEC rules cover areas such as operating a digital asset exchange, token issuance, operating digital assets offering platform, and requirements for digital asset custodians. Under the new guidelines, all crypto exchangers providing service to Nigerians are now required to secure a permit, which mandates the commission to have access to their records. Such exchanges are also expected to submit weekly and monthly trading information as well as quarterly and annual financial and compliance reports.</p>
<p>The new rule restrains an exchange from facilitating the trading of any digital asset unless SEC has first issued a “no objection” about such asset. This implies that an exchange will need to submit applications for every asset it intends to list, and the application should prove that the exchange has sufficient information about the project and its associated risks.</p>
<p>The new guidelines stated that the SEC will allow projects to raise up to N10 billion — based on the official exchange rate.</p>
<p>On token issuance, the SEC states that any project seeking to conduct initial coin offerings within Nigeria or targeting Nigerians must register its intent with the Commission by filing an assessment form and submitting a detailed copy of its whitepaper.</p>
<p>Should the SEC consider the proposed token security, the issuer has to comply with the country’s securities laws.</p>
<p>According to SEC, a DAOP operator must of necessity conduct due diligence on any project seeking to offer digital assets through its platform and exercise its judgment on whether the project is fit to raise funds.</p>
<p>SEC postulates a review of applications within 30days before determining if the digital asset proposed to be offered constitutes a &#8220;security&#8221;.</p>
<p>According to the commission, the new guidelines shall apply to all issuers seeking to raise capital through digital asset offerings, adding that it provides that issuers may only raise funds within a limit of N10 billion.</p>
<p>The commission, however, added that it could adjust the ceiling from time to time.</p>
<p>It revealed that digital asset actors include Digital Asset Offering Platforms (DAOPs), Digital Asset Custodians (DACs), Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs), and Digital Assets Exchange (DAX).</p>
<p>According to the new regulation, SEC said it would accommodate DAOPs provided it tendered evidence of a minimum paid-up capital of N500 million and a current fidelity bond covering at least 25 per cent of the minimum paid-up capital.</p>
<p>The regulation requires applicants seeking to register a DAOP to pay NGN100,000 for the filing or application fee, NGN300,000 for the processing fee, NGN30 million for the registration fee, and NGN100,000 for sponsored individuals.</p>
<p>Despite the SEC&#8217;s new regulations, it is still not certain whether Nigeria is ready to fully regulate cryptocurrency activities. This is because the Nigerian apex bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has continued to mandate all financial institutions in Nigeria to steer clear of cryptocurrencies and should not allow any crypto-related entities to open bank accounts in financial institutions, this has pushed virtually all individuals engaging in cryptocurrency activities in Nigeria to engage only in what is known as peer-to-peer trading. However, it is expected that the new SEC regulations may force the CBN to reconsider its stance on cryptocurrency transactions in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO START A BUSINESS IN NIGERIA </strong></p>
<p>In Nigeria, foreign investments have been a great boost to the economy. It is to be noted that Nigeria operates a free market economy hence, there are no restrictions on foreigners starting a business in Nigeria subject to the fulfilment of certain requirements.</p>
<p>We shall briefly explain the main requirements and steps by which a foreigner can invest or start a business in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The following are key steps a foreigner wishing to establish a business in Nigeria must follow.</p>
<ol>
<li>Incorporation/Registration of a business</li>
<li>Registration with Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission(NIPC)</li>
<li>Approval for Business Permits</li>
<li>Immigration Requirements and Residence Permit(CERPAC)/ Application for Expatriate Quota</li>
<li>Bank Account Opening</li>
<li>Procurement of Certificate of Capital Importation</li>
<li>Taxation Registration</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us briefly discuss the above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>INCORPORATION OF A BUSINESS</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is instructive to note that only registered businesses in Nigeria are recognized by law to lawfully carry-on business in Nigeria save for a few exemptions. A foreigner who seeks to commence business in Nigeria must register the same; the agency in charge of business registration is the Corporate Affairs Commission. The Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020 (“CAMA”) puts this in proper perspective as it provides in Section 78 as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Subject to sections 80 &#8211; 83 of this Act, every foreign company which before or after the commencement of this Act was incorporated outside Nigeria, and having the intention of carrying on business in Nigeria, shall take all steps necessary to obtain incorporation as a separate entity in Nigeria for that purpose, but until so incorporated, the foreign company shall not carry on business in Nigeria or exercise any of the powers of a registered company and shall not have a place of business or an address for service of documents or processes in Nigeria for any purpose other than the receipt of notices and other documents, as matters preliminary to incorporation under this Act.</strong> </em></li>
</ul>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>The Act also stipulates the types of business in which a person including a foreigner can be involved and they include a Limited Liability Company, an Unlimited Liability Company and a Company Limited by Guarantee.</p>
<p>A foreigner can also enter into a partnership with a Nigerian to form a business. This partnership arrangement may be limited or unlimited. A limited partnership is where a partner’s liability is limited to the value of capital contributed to form the business or unlimited where the partners’ liabilities are not limited.</p>
<p>In registering a business, Section 852 of CAMA provides a guide as to the types of names a company can be registered with.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above already stated, section 80 of CAMA provides that a foreign company may be exempted from the registration upon certain grounds.</p>
<p>Section 80 provides as follows:</p>
<p><em>  <strong>       (1) A foreign company may apply to the Minister for exemption from the provisions of section 78 of this Act if that foreign company belongs to one of the following categories, that is— (a) foreign companies other than those specified in paragraph (d), invited to Nigeria by or with the approval of the       Federal Government to execute any specified individual project; (b) foreign companies which are in Nigeria for the execution of specific individual loan projects on behalf of a donor country or international organisation; (c)    foreign government-owned companies engaged solely in export promotion activities; and (d) engineering consultants and technical experts engaged on any individual specialist project under contract with any of the governments in the Federation or any of their agencies or with any other body or person,  where such contract has been approved by the Federal Government.</strong></em></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong><u>REGISTRATION WITH THE NIGERIAN INVESTMENT PROMOTION COMMISSION (NIPC)</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>NIPC is an agency of the Federal Government saddled with the responsibility of coordinating and monitoring all foreign investments activities in Nigeria. The Federal Government of Nigeria, has tasked the investment promotion agency with attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) over the years.</p>
<p>The Commission initiates and supports measures which shall enhance the investment climate in Nigeria for both Nigerian and non-Nigerian investors.</p>
<p>Registration with the NIPC is compulsory for all foreigners intending to carry out business in Nigeria. Upon receipt of registration forms, the NIPC within fourteen working days will register the business after being satisfied with the relevant documents. The registration with NIPC guarantee foreign investments in Nigeria from expropriation.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong><u>BUSINESS PERMITS FROM MINISTR OF INTERIOR</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A business permit is a document issued by the Federal Ministry of Interior through the Department of Citizenship and Business. This document allows for the operation of businesses in Nigeria by foreigners. The importance of this permit is that it ensures that foreign companies are not edging out Nigerian organizations with businesses that domestic companies already engage in.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Section 36 of the Immigration Act, it provides that <em>no person other than a Nigerian citizen shall, on his own account or in partnership with any other person, practice a profession or establish or take over any trade or business whatsoever or register or take over any company with limited liability for any purpose without the written consent of the Minister of Internal Affairs.</em></p>
<p>It must be known that a business permit is required where the company is entirely owned by the foreigners or where a foreign entity is engaging in a joint venture with a Nigerian Corporation.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>IMMIGRATION REQUIREMENTS AND RESIDENCE PERMIT (CERPAC)/EXPARTRIATE QUOTA</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Combined Expatriate Residence Permit and Aliens Card (CERPAC) is the official name for the Residence and Work Permit in Nigeria. It is a card issued to an expatriate or foreigner allowing him to live and work in Nigeria for a specified period of time. In Nigeria, the Comptroller General of Immigration is empowered to issue a Nigerian residence permit under the watch of the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<p>An Expatriate Quota, on the other hand, is an approval granted to companies to employ the services of foreigners with relevant skills with a view to transferring the same to Nigerian understudies. It states the number of foreigners allowed to work in the company and this is done to check the indiscriminate employment of foreigners where there are already competent Nigerians to do the same. Also, it is only granted to registered entities.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>BANK ACCOUNT OPENING</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Most foreigners setting up a company in Nigeria often require a bank account opening for ease of doing business, although no law mandates that a foreigner should open a bank account. To open a bank account in Nigeria, all foreigners listed as directors of the company must have to enrol for Bank Verification Number (BVN). Foreigners in overseas can also apply for BVN at designated centres abroad. Regardless of having BVN, the Nigerian banks may demand that any foreigner (either as a director or any other staff) seeking to become a signatory to the bank account must maintain a Nigerian residency status (having CERPAC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>PROCUREMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF CAPITAL IMPORTATION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A Certificate of Capital Importation better known as CCI is a document obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria through the commercial banks. The certificate proves that cash, equipment or a combination of both from foreign investors have been received by an entity incorporated in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The CCI can be gotten from an authorized dealer (commercial banks).</p>
<p>The CCI confers on the foreign investor the right to repatriate capital, dividends and profits at the official foreign exchange market rates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (TIN) &amp; TAX REGISTRATION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Taxes are administered for the running of the government through the different tiers or levels of government. The local councils manage the local government levies, the state taxes are collected by the State Internal Revenue Services, and the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) collect and manage federal taxes. Evading the payment of tax attracts fines and other punitive penalties under Nigerian law. All registered businesses must obtain a TIN upon commencement of business as this unique number enables the payment of taxes. Nowadays, TIN comes with a certificate of incorporation after the company is registered. Apart from having TIN, every registered company within 6 months of incorporation must endeavour to register with the nearby FIRS office to the address of business operation or registered address. Some of the most common taxes payable in Nigeria are Company Income Tax (CIT), Personal Income Tax (otherwise known as PAYE Tax) and Value Added Services on vatable products and services.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>As shown above, Nigeria operates a free-market economy and readily invites foreign investors to bring in their expertise for the growth of the nation’s economy. This is however subject to all procedures and requirements duly complied with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Personal Income Tax (PIT) is a tax imposed on individuals including employees, partners in a partnership, unincorporated trusts, joint ventures, families and communities. It is imposed based on source and residency rules. The two key legislation are the Personal Income Tax Amendment Act 2011 (PITAM) and Finance Act 2020.</p>
<p>Personal Income Tax in Nigeria is on a Pay As You Earn (PAYE) basis, which means that the tax is deducted at the source by the employer as the employee earns the income. Every person who earns income either from employment or from running his own business must pay PERSONAL TAX to the State Internal Revenue Service. For those in employment, it is the responsibility of the employer to deduct tax from employee’s salaries and remit it to the relevant State Internal Revenue Service or FCT-IRS in the case of employees’ resident within the Federal Capital Territory. The people who run their own businesses have the responsibilities to pay their PAYE tax to relevant authorities.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, PAYE Income Tax is a calculation based on the amount you earn. Income tax is calculated on a threshold basis with different rates applied depending on your income.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule 6 PITA</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with Schedule 6 of PITA, the following guide can be followed in calculating the PAYE tax.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="208">Annual Taxable Income (NGN)</td>
<td width="208">Rates</td>
<td width="208">Tax payable per annum (NGN)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="208">First 300,000</td>
<td width="208">7%</td>
<td width="208">21,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="208">Next 300,000</td>
<td width="208">11%</td>
<td width="208">33,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="208">Next 500,000</td>
<td width="208">15%</td>
<td width="208">75,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="208">Next 500,000</td>
<td width="208">19%</td>
<td width="208">95,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="208">Next 1,600,000</td>
<td width="208">21%</td>
<td width="208">336,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="208">Above 3,200,000</td>
<td width="208">24%</td>
<td width="208">Multiply only the excess amount over NGN 3.2 million by 24%. For example, an annual taxable income of NGN 5 million is (5-3.2) million *24%= NGN 432,000.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those earning minimum wage or less from employment are exempted from personal income taxes.</p>
<p>As a result of the consolidated relief allowance of at most 21% of gross income, the top marginal tax rate is 18.96% for income above ₦20 million as only 79% of income is taxed at 24%, while for income below ₦20 million the top marginal rate is 19.2%.</p>
<p>Every taxable person (excluding persons who earn the minimum wage or below) is liable to a minimum income tax of 1% of their gross income. This is triggered where the actual tax payable after all reliefs and allowances is less than 1% of gross income. Minimum tax will not apply to a person in any year of assessment where such person earns the National Minimum Wage or less from an employment.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Benefits in Kind (S.4, 5) PITA</strong></p>
<p>Benefits in Kind (BIK) provided to an employee by the employer such as official cars, accommodation, etc. are deemed to be part of the employee’s gross emoluments. For items other than accommodation, the deemed annual benefit is 5% of the cost where the asset is owned by the employer, or the actual rent paid where the asset is leased by the employer.</p>
<p>BIK on accommodation is taxable based on the annual value of the premises as determined for purposes of local rates or as determined by the relevant tax authority.</p>
<p>Other things to take notice of concerning PAYE</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filing and due dates {S.41(3)} PITA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals are to file returns not later than 31 March annually in respect of the preceding year.</p>
<p>Employers are required to file the following documents:</p>
<ol>
<li>Employers’ Declaration Form (Form H1): showing the income of the employees, taxes deducted and remitted in the preceding year. This is due by 31 January.</li>
<li>Employers’ Remittance Card (Form G): showing the monthly remittances and reference number on the receipt. Copies of the receipt are to accompany the form G.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Declaration of estimated income and application for tax reliefs (Form A).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Due date for payment {S.41(3), 81} PITA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>PAYE must be remitted on or before the 10th day of the month following the payment of salary (e.g., PAYE tax deducted from January salary should be remitted by the 10th of February).</p>
<p>For individuals under direct assessment, payment must be made along with returns within 90 days of the fiscal year i.e., not later than 31 March.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correspondence &#8211; Notice of Assessment and Objections (S.58) PITA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Courier service, email and other electronic means are validly recognized as means of correspondence for issuance of assessment and raising valid objections.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Penalty for non-payment of tax (S.76, 77) PITA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The penalty for non-payment of PAYE is 10% per annum of the amount plus interest on an annual basis at the bank lending rate (in practice a one-off interest rate of 15% to 21% is applied). Late filing attracts a fine of ₦500,000 in the case of corporate bodies, and ₦50,000 in the case of individuals</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Statute of Limitation (S.55) PITA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The limitation applicable to PAYE tax liability is 6 years except in the event of fraud, willful default or neglect by the taxable person in which case there is no limitation.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The new Finance Bill signed into law on the 13<sup>th</sup> of January 2020 places more stringent penalties for default of payment of PAYE tax. It is a wake-up call for individuals and every Nigerian business owner to understand and diligently remit PAYE taxes to the relevant authorities.</p>
