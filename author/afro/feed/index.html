										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In every capital market, it is expedient to have a benchmark for making decisions and a tool for envisaging the risk associated with such decisions. Thus, ratings play an important role in the Nigerian Capital Market and the global financial system at large. It is a tool needed to promote the development and seamless running of the country&#8217;s financial market by giving an informed opinion about credit risk.</p>
<p>Nigeria’s <a href="https://sec.gov.ng/glossary/rating-agencies/">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) simply described rating agencies</a> as “institutions which, as a business, professionally evaluate the investment qualities of debt issues”. It is a company that evaluates and assesses the financial strength of companies and government entities in line with their debt and equities instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Functions </strong></p>
<p>Rating agencies shall have the following functions amongst others:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provision of credit ratings to governments and other entities;</li>
<li>Provision of ratings to the debt and equities instruments;</li>
<li>Rating of the credit worthiness of collective investment schemes;</li>
<li>Other services ancillary to the function.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Registration requirements</strong></p>
<p>Below are the registration requirements of a rating agency in accordance with Rule 114 of SEC, 2013;</p>
<p>(1) For the purpose of these rules and regulations, a rating agency shall be a private or public limited company, incorporated in Nigeria under the Companies and Allied Matters Act or exempted from registration in accordance with these rules.</p>
<p>(2) The Commission may consider on a case by case basis granting a foreign credit rating agency a registration exemption certificate to enable it participate in any transaction in the capital market, provided such credit rating agency is validly registered in a jurisdiction that has established regulatory and supervisory framework in accordance with the standards set out by IOSCO. Evidence of such registration, including such additional supporting documents as may be specified by the Commission from time to time, shall be filed along with the application for the registration exemption certificate.</p>
<p>(3) A rating agency in Nigeria that is affiliated to a foreign rating company shall supply the following information:-</p>

<p>(b) a copy of the certificate of incorporation certified by the Corporate Affairs Commission;</p>
<p>(c) a copy of the Memorandum and Articles of Association certified by the Corporate Affairs Commission, which shall among others include the power to act as a rating agency;</p>

<p>(g) application for registration of a minimum of two sponsored individuals one of whom shall be the chief executive officer. The two principal officers of the rating agency who shall be registered as sponsored officers must have a minimum of first degree of professional qualification in accounting, economics, statistics or banking and finance with not less than ten (10) years post-qualification experience;</p>
<p>(h) existing or proposed by-laws or rules, guidelines and code of conduct;</p>
<p>(i) details of rating criteria, methodology and principles;</p>
<p>(j) an undertaking to promptly furnish the Commission with copies of any amendments to its Memorandum and Articles of Association, certified by the Corporate Affairs Commission, code of conduct, guidelines, etc., within fourteen (14) working days of such alteration:</p>
<p>(k) Provided that a certified copy of all relevant resolutions are forwarded to the Commission within two (2) days of the passing of the resolutions;</p>
<p>(l) sworn undertaking to keep such records and render such returns as may be specified by the Commission from time to time. Such returns shall include among others—</p>
<ol>
<li>name(s) of company/securities/issue(s) rated;</li>
<li>the rating given including any changes in previous rating (if any);</li>
</ol>
<p>iii. rating methodology (including basic assumptions);</p>
<ol>
<li>an appropriate application/registration fee as determined by the Commission from time to time; and</li>
<li>sworn undertaking that the rating agency shall comply with the Act, the rules and regulations, the Companies and Allied Matters Act and any other relevant legislation(s).</li>
</ol>
<p>(5) The code of conduct for management and staff of the agency shall include:-</p>
<ol>
<li>a) a provision prohibiting key officers of the rating firm from investing in clients’ shares;</li>
<li>b) an undertaking to disclose to the Commission any shareholding interest of 5% and above of its directors and staff and their relatives in any issue to be rated;</li>
<li>c) a provision specifying any relationship with clients;</li>
</ol>
<p>(d) provision for disclosure of its board of directors’ interest in any of the rated issues;</p>
<p>(e) a sworn undertaking that undue advantage would not be taken of any unpublished price-sensitive information;</p>
<p>(f) a provision on disciplinary measures for any misconduct or noncompliance by management and staff.</p>
<p>(6) Sworn undertaking that every employee of an agency shall display a high standard of professionalism and integrity in the conduct of his business.</p>
<p>(7) Sworn undertaking that no rating would be carried out where adequate, accurate and timely material information had not been obtained.</p>

<p>(10) Any other document or information required by the Commission from time to time.</p>
<p>(11) Rule 83(3) and (4) shall, with all necessary modifications, apply in case of denial or suspension of registration of rating agencies.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Rules and regulations have been set up by the Nigerian Government to make the rating agencies subject to regulatory controls in order to reinforce the integrity and independence of the institution. It is, however, noteworthy that there are just three rating agencies approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, namely; Agustus &amp; Co. Ltd., and Datapro Ltd, Global Credit Ratings Co. Ltd.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fiduciary role of a trustee has its origin from the English Common Law and the principles of Equity. This concept has authorized the trustee to be an independent third party saddled with the responsibility of protecting conflicting interests between the issuer and investor in the financial market. A trustee is usually hired by an issuer to oversee the implementation of a bond between the bond issuer and a bondholder.</p>
<p><strong>Functions</strong></p>
<p>The functions of trustees shall be as follows:-</p>
<p><strong>In respect of collective investment scheme: </strong></p>

<li>Hold and enforce (where necessary) such securities on behalf of investors or lenders.</li>
<li>Hold and administer sinking funds where applicable.</li>
<li>Monitor the register of bonds/unit holders.</li>
<li>Perform all other functions stipulated in the requisite trust deed, ISA, CAMA,TIA and other legislations.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Registration requirements</strong></p>
<p>Below are the registration requirements of a Trustee as stipulated by Rule 109 of SEC, 2013;</p>
<p>(1) An application for registration as trustee shall be filed on Form S.E.C. 4A and shall be accompanied by-;</p>
<p>(a) a minimum of two (2) sets of completed Form S.E.C. 2 to be filed by the sponsored individuals;</p>

<p>(3) Rule 83 (3) and (4) shall, with all necessary modifications, apply in case of denial or suspension of registration of a trustee.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Investors have engaged the services of brokers or dealers for easy participation in the financial world as the financial world can be full of mysteries and risks for investors especially when the languages and terms of the market are not understood.</p>
<p>Thus, a broker can be seen to be a financial intermediary executing order on behalf of his clients. That is, a broker facilitates securities trades on behalf of investors. Meanwhile, a dealer makes trades on his own account.</p>
<p><strong>Functions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brokers</strong></p>
<p>Registered brokers shall have the following functions amongst others:-</p>
<ol>
<li>A broker facilitates sale and purchase of securities on a recognized securities exchange on behalf of his clients.</li>
<li>A broker discloses to the Commission any dealings in a security valued at a minimum of N50 million executed in a single deal or in multiple deals on the same day on behalf of his clients.</li>
<li>A broker is expected to report any suspected market manipulation or insider dealing to the Commission within 48hrs.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Dealers</strong></p>
<p>Registered dealers shall have the following functions amongst others:-</p>
<p>1.A dealer facilitates sale and purchase of securities on a recognized securities exchange on his own account;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>A dealer discloses to the Commission any dealings in a security valued at a minimum of N50 million executed in a single deal or in multiple deals on the same day on his own account.</li>
<li>A dealer is expected to report any suspected market manipulation or insider dealing to the Commission within 48hrs.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Registration requirements</strong></p>
<p>It is however unlawful for any broker or dealer to effect a transaction or attempt to engage in any transaction except such a person is registered with SEC and in accordance to Rule 55 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, 2013. Below are the requirements;</p>
<p>An application for registration as broker/dealer shall be filed on Form S.E.C. 3 contained in schedule III to these rules and regulations and shall be accompanied by:-</p>
<p>(1) a minimum of two sets of completed Form S.E.C. 2 to be filed by the sponsored individuals;</p>
<p>(2) a copy of Certificate of Incorporation certified by the Corporate Affairs Commission (C.A.C.); where a copy not certified is filed, the applicant shall present the original copy for sighting by an authorized officer of the Commission;</p>
<p>(3) a copy of Memorandum and Articles of Association certified by the Corporate Affairs Commission which among others shall include the power to act as a broker/dealer;</p>
<p>(4) a copy of CAC Form containing particulars of directors certified by the Corporate Affairs Commission;</p>
<p>(5) copy of latest audited accounts or audited statement of affairs for companies in operation for less than one (1) year;</p>
<p>(6) profile of the company covering among others brief history of the company organizational structure, shareholding structure, principal officers, etc. (see Form S.E.C. 3 for details);</p>
<p>(7) Fidelity bond representing 20% of paid-up capital;</p>
<p>(8) sworn undertaking to keep proper records and render returns;</p>

<li>The period between the lodgment and verification of a certificate shall not exceed ten (10) days provided that where there is a need to exceed the prescribed period, the broker/dealer shall notify the Commission justifying the need for an extension of time.</li>
<li>Where the security is available, the broker with the mandate to buy shall execute its client’s order including lodgment within five (5) working days: Provided that where the security is not available within the stipulated period, the broker shall revert to the client for further instructions.</li>
<li>In the case of nominal transfer, the broker shall submit evidence of verification and lodgment with the registrar within five (5) days and the certificates (where applicable) mailed by registered post by the broker to the clients within five (5) days of collection from the registrar.</li>
<li>Unauthorized disposal of securities or non-purchase or delay in purchase of securities where available and non-remittance of the proceeds of sale to client shall attract a penalty of at least N100,000 and a further sum of not less than N5,000 for every day from the date of disposal without authority, or date mandate was supposed to be executed or date proceeds were supposed to be remitted</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>The brokers and dealers are key players in the activities leading to the public offers of securities. A broker acts as an agent by engaging in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others while a dealer acts as a principal by engaging in the business of effecting transactions in securities for his own account. The stockbroker is also regulated by the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers Act.</p>
