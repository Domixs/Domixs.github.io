										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO START A BUSINESS IN NIGERIA </strong></p>
<p>In Nigeria, foreign investments have been a great boost to the economy. It is to be noted that Nigeria operates a free market economy hence, there are no restrictions on foreigners starting a business in Nigeria subject to the fulfilment of certain requirements.</p>
<p>We shall briefly explain the main requirements and steps by which a foreigner can invest or start a business in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The following are key steps a foreigner wishing to establish a business in Nigeria must follow.</p>
<ol>
<li>Incorporation/Registration of a business</li>
<li>Registration with Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission(NIPC)</li>
<li>Approval for Business Permits</li>
<li>Immigration Requirements and Residence Permit(CERPAC)/ Application for Expatriate Quota</li>
<li>Bank Account Opening</li>
<li>Procurement of Certificate of Capital Importation</li>
<li>Taxation Registration</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us briefly discuss the above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>INCORPORATION OF A BUSINESS</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is instructive to note that only registered businesses in Nigeria are recognized by law to lawfully carry-on business in Nigeria save for a few exemptions. A foreigner who seeks to commence business in Nigeria must register the same; the agency in charge of business registration is the Corporate Affairs Commission. The Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020 (“CAMA”) puts this in proper perspective as it provides in Section 78 as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Subject to sections 80 &#8211; 83 of this Act, every foreign company which before or after the commencement of this Act was incorporated outside Nigeria, and having the intention of carrying on business in Nigeria, shall take all steps necessary to obtain incorporation as a separate entity in Nigeria for that purpose, but until so incorporated, the foreign company shall not carry on business in Nigeria or exercise any of the powers of a registered company and shall not have a place of business or an address for service of documents or processes in Nigeria for any purpose other than the receipt of notices and other documents, as matters preliminary to incorporation under this Act.</strong> </em></li>
</ul>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>The Act also stipulates the types of business in which a person including a foreigner can be involved and they include a Limited Liability Company, an Unlimited Liability Company and a Company Limited by Guarantee.</p>
<p>A foreigner can also enter into a partnership with a Nigerian to form a business. This partnership arrangement may be limited or unlimited. A limited partnership is where a partner’s liability is limited to the value of capital contributed to form the business or unlimited where the partners’ liabilities are not limited.</p>
<p>In registering a business, Section 852 of CAMA provides a guide as to the types of names a company can be registered with.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above already stated, section 80 of CAMA provides that a foreign company may be exempted from the registration upon certain grounds.</p>
<p>Section 80 provides as follows:</p>
<p><em>  <strong>       (1) A foreign company may apply to the Minister for exemption from the provisions of section 78 of this Act if that foreign company belongs to one of the following categories, that is— (a) foreign companies other than those specified in paragraph (d), invited to Nigeria by or with the approval of the       Federal Government to execute any specified individual project; (b) foreign companies which are in Nigeria for the execution of specific individual loan projects on behalf of a donor country or international organisation; (c)    foreign government-owned companies engaged solely in export promotion activities; and (d) engineering consultants and technical experts engaged on any individual specialist project under contract with any of the governments in the Federation or any of their agencies or with any other body or person,  where such contract has been approved by the Federal Government.</strong></em></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong><u>REGISTRATION WITH THE NIGERIAN INVESTMENT PROMOTION COMMISSION (NIPC)</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>NIPC is an agency of the Federal Government saddled with the responsibility of coordinating and monitoring all foreign investments activities in Nigeria. The Federal Government of Nigeria, has tasked the investment promotion agency with attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) over the years.</p>
<p>The Commission initiates and supports measures which shall enhance the investment climate in Nigeria for both Nigerian and non-Nigerian investors.</p>
<p>Registration with the NIPC is compulsory for all foreigners intending to carry out business in Nigeria. Upon receipt of registration forms, the NIPC within fourteen working days will register the business after being satisfied with the relevant documents. The registration with NIPC guarantee foreign investments in Nigeria from expropriation.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong><u>BUSINESS PERMITS FROM MINISTR OF INTERIOR</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A business permit is a document issued by the Federal Ministry of Interior through the Department of Citizenship and Business. This document allows for the operation of businesses in Nigeria by foreigners. The importance of this permit is that it ensures that foreign companies are not edging out Nigerian organizations with businesses that domestic companies already engage in.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Section 36 of the Immigration Act, it provides that <em>no person other than a Nigerian citizen shall, on his own account or in partnership with any other person, practice a profession or establish or take over any trade or business whatsoever or register or take over any company with limited liability for any purpose without the written consent of the Minister of Internal Affairs.</em></p>
<p>It must be known that a business permit is required where the company is entirely owned by the foreigners or where a foreign entity is engaging in a joint venture with a Nigerian Corporation.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>IMMIGRATION REQUIREMENTS AND RESIDENCE PERMIT (CERPAC)/EXPARTRIATE QUOTA</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Combined Expatriate Residence Permit and Aliens Card (CERPAC) is the official name for the Residence and Work Permit in Nigeria. It is a card issued to an expatriate or foreigner allowing him to live and work in Nigeria for a specified period of time. In Nigeria, the Comptroller General of Immigration is empowered to issue a Nigerian residence permit under the watch of the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<p>An Expatriate Quota, on the other hand, is an approval granted to companies to employ the services of foreigners with relevant skills with a view to transferring the same to Nigerian understudies. It states the number of foreigners allowed to work in the company and this is done to check the indiscriminate employment of foreigners where there are already competent Nigerians to do the same. Also, it is only granted to registered entities.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>BANK ACCOUNT OPENING</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Most foreigners setting up a company in Nigeria often require a bank account opening for ease of doing business, although no law mandates that a foreigner should open a bank account. To open a bank account in Nigeria, all foreigners listed as directors of the company must have to enrol for Bank Verification Number (BVN). Foreigners in overseas can also apply for BVN at designated centres abroad. Regardless of having BVN, the Nigerian banks may demand that any foreigner (either as a director or any other staff) seeking to become a signatory to the bank account must maintain a Nigerian residency status (having CERPAC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>PROCUREMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF CAPITAL IMPORTATION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A Certificate of Capital Importation better known as CCI is a document obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria through the commercial banks. The certificate proves that cash, equipment or a combination of both from foreign investors have been received by an entity incorporated in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The CCI can be gotten from an authorized dealer (commercial banks).</p>
<p>The CCI confers on the foreign investor the right to repatriate capital, dividends and profits at the official foreign exchange market rates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (TIN) &amp; TAX REGISTRATION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Taxes are administered for the running of the government through the different tiers or levels of government. The local councils manage the local government levies, the state taxes are collected by the State Internal Revenue Services, and the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) collect and manage federal taxes. Evading the payment of tax attracts fines and other punitive penalties under Nigerian law. All registered businesses must obtain a TIN upon commencement of business as this unique number enables the payment of taxes. Nowadays, TIN comes with a certificate of incorporation after the company is registered. Apart from having TIN, every registered company within 6 months of incorporation must endeavour to register with the nearby FIRS office to the address of business operation or registered address. Some of the most common taxes payable in Nigeria are Company Income Tax (CIT), Personal Income Tax (otherwise known as PAYE Tax) and Value Added Services on vatable products and services.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>As shown above, Nigeria operates a free-market economy and readily invites foreign investors to bring in their expertise for the growth of the nation’s economy. This is however subject to all procedures and requirements duly complied with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The commission in charge of company regulations is the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), which was established by virtue of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) to regulate the formations and operations of companies in Nigeria.</p>
<p>A private company is any company having the liability of its members limited by the memorandum and articles of association to the amount unpaid on the shares respectively held by them or a company having the liability of its members limited by the memorandum of association to such amount as the members undertake to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of its being wound up.</p>
<p>There have been various developments with respect to company registration in Nigeria. Company formation can now be completed online in Nigeria and the electronic certificate downloadable online has been introduced in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements for Registration of Company in Nigeria</strong></p>
<p>Below are the requirements an applicant must provide to commence the registration of a company in Nigeria:</p>
<ol>
<li>The registered address of the proposed company</li>
<li>Email and phone number of the proposed company</li>
<li>Forms of identification such as National Identity Card, International Passport, Driver’s license of the directors and shareholders.</li>
<li>Approval note of name reservation from CAC</li>
<li>Director(s) &amp; shareholders(s) full names, residential address, occupation and date of birth.</li>
<li>Objects of the company</li>
<li>Statutory fees and Stamp duty</li>
<li>Incorporation certificate and company resolution where another registered company (either local or foreign) will be a shareholder or subscriber to the proposed company.</li>
</ol>
<p>For registration of the company the below are the steps required:</p>
<ol>
<li>Submission of two desired company names for search</li>
<li>Preparation of the Memorandum and Articles of Association(MEMART)</li>
<li>Complete the Pre-registration form and statement of share capital</li>
<li>Pay the Stamp duty and filing Fee</li>
<li>Uploading relevant documents</li>
<li>Submission of registration application online.</li>
<li>Where the registration is approved, the electronic incorporation certificates together with the Tax Identification Number and other incorporation documents will be issued by CAC.</li>
<li>Download the certificate, MEMART and Application Status online</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the CAC registration must be carried out strictly in compliance with the authorized share capital required for each business. For instance, a company intending to engage in a freight forwarding business must have a minimum of Five Million Naira authorized share capital, and where any foreigner is to be involved in the proposed company, the authorized share capital must not be less than Ten Million Naira.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New business owners often have a lot of questions about the difference between a registered business name and an incorporated company limited by shares and which of these best suit their business needs. In light of this fact, some of the differences between a business name and a company limited by liability will be briefly discussed below.</p>
<ol>
<li>A company limited by shares is required to have a director(s) and shareholder(s) while a business name is only required to have a sole proprietor or partners (proprietors).</li>
<li>A Company limited by shares is a separate legal entity that is distinct from its shareholders and directors. It can sue and be sued, own properties and other assets in its corporate name. A business name on the other hand has no distinct legal personality from the owner and can sue or be sued only in the name of the owner(s) of such a business.</li>
<li>A company limited by shares is a taxable legal person and pays its taxes to the Federal Inland Revenue Service(FIRS) in its corporate name under the Companies Income Tax Act. A business name does not pay taxes to the FIRS, rather, it is the proprietor of such a business that is required to pay taxes under the Personal Income Tax Act to the State Board of Internal Revenue.</li>
<li>A company limited by shares acquires a legal personality upon incorporation. The liabilities of the shareholders of the company are limited by the number of shares that have been allotted to such shareholders that have not been paid for in the event of winding up(shutting down of company). What this means is that if the company has debts or liabilities, the debtor cannot go after the personal assets of the shareholders of the company as they are only liable to pay for the number of shares that have been allotted to them that have not been paid for. However, if a registered business name goes bankrupt or runs into debt, the debtors can sue and recover their money from the personal assets of the owner of such a business.</li>
<li>A company limited by shares obtains a certificate of incorporation and other documents such as Memorandum and Articles of Association (MEMART) upon registration with the Corporate Affairs Commission(CAC). This is important as most organizations and government agencies require these documents to award contracts or to do business with a company. A business name on the other hand obtains a certificate of registration of business name and application for registration of business, it is limited in capacity to bid for big contracts from government agencies or other companies.</li>
<li>A company limited by shares can have a maximum of 50(fifty) shareholders while a business name can have a maximum of 20 partners except for law and accounting firms.</li>
<li>A company limited by shares is required to file returns at the CAC and hold annual general meetings while a business name is not required to hold general meetings before reaching its decisions.</li>
<li>A company limited by shares can obtain a loan in the name of the company and can also raise funds by issuing its shares to private investors. A business name does not have shares and is mostly funded from the personal funds of the owner.</li>
<li>A company limited by shares is appropriate for medium scale to large scale businesses while a business name is appropriate for small scale to medium scale businesses.</li>
<li>A limited company may choose to go public and be converted to a public limited company (PLC), whereas a business name can only be converted to a limited liability company.</li>
<li>A business name is automatically dissolved upon the death of its founder(s) unless there are other surviving partners to carry on the business, but a limited liability company cannot be dissolved upon the death of the shareholder, the other director of the company will continue to carry on the business upon the demise of any shareholder or director. And where the company has a single director/shareholder that died, the family of such person can apply for a Letter of Administration or Probate to take over the shares of the company and appoint a new director. A limited liability company will not be dissolved until it has been officially wound up with the CAC in accordance with the law.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, all of the above are distinctions between the business name and the company limited by shares. However, it is important to know that there is also a similarity between the two forms of business entities. In line with the Companies and Allied Matters Act 2020, the law governing business formation in Nigeria, either the company or business name can be set up by just a single person.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>12 FACTS YOU MUST KNOW BEFORE  A COMPANY REGISTRATION &amp; BANK ACCOUNT OPENING IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>Registering a company is the first step toward doing business in Nigeria. There are important facts every person intending to register a company in Nigeria must be aware of. Below are 12 key facts about company registration in Nigeria</p>
<ol>
<li>The sole government agency responsible for company registration in Nigeria is the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and all applications for company registration must be channelled to the CAC. The CAC derives its powers and authority from the Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020 (CAMA). Unlike a country like the United States where it is possible to register a company in various states, company registration in Nigeria is under the control of the Federal Government and the only Federal Government in charge of incorporation is the <a href="https://www.cac.gov.ng/">CAC.</a></li>
<li>The most suitable form of business structure in Nigeria is a private company limited by shares. There are other business structures such as public companies limited by shares, business name, etc. however, the most common and suitable structure for business ventures in Nigeria is a private company limited by shares.</li>
<li>A company can have only 1(one) shareholder and only one(1) company director provided that any foreigner will not be among shareholders or directors. The same person can stand as both a shareholder and company director in a company. However, a person who is below the age of 18 is not eligible to be a company director in Nigeria.</li>
<li>A company secretary is no longer a mandatory requirement for all companies in Nigeria. however, where a company intends to have a company secretary, such a company secretary must be resident in Nigeria. Besides, where the shareholder or director of a company will involve a foreigner, such a company must appoint a secretary during registration</li>
<li>Registering a company in Nigeria does not automatically qualify one to engage in all kinds of business. Some industries are subject to special regulatory control and licenses must be obtained from the industries’ regulator before one can engage in a business in such industries. For instance, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission Permit is required to engage in the Nigerian oil &amp; gas industry.</li>
<li>All companies must have a registered office address in Nigeria at the point of incorporation.</li>
<li>Although Nigerian companies do not expire once registered and are not subject to renewal, however, all companies registered in Nigeria are required to file annual returns with the CAC. This can be filed by a solicitor on behalf of the company. The documents required for filing annual returns with the CAC are:
<ul>
<li>The requisite CAC Annual Returns Form</li>
<li>An audited account of the company</li>
<li>Evidence of payment of all required fees and dues</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>All registered companies now come with a Tax Identification Number(TIN), which is required for opening a corporate bank account.</li>
<li>All company incorporation documents are now issued electronically, which include the Memorandum and Articles of Association(MEMART), Certificate of Incorporation and Application for Registration of Company (formerly CAC Form 2 and Form 7) after the registration of the company has been completed.</li>
<li>The minimum <a href="https://www.resolutionlawng.com/cac-share-capital-threshold-for-company-registration/">share capital threshold</a> applies to some categories of business in Nigeria. What this implies is that before someone can register a company to engage in business in some industries, the company must have a certain share capital amount. For instance, any company wishing to engage in maritime must have a minimum of Twenty Five Million Naira Share Capital.</li>
<li>Where a foreigner is a director and/or shareholder of a company in Nigeria, the company is required to have a minimum authorized share capital of 10 Million Naira. The CAC or the government does not require evidence of payment of the share capital during company registration.</li>
<li>Registration of a company in Nigeria does not automatically qualify a foreigner to be a signatory to a corporate bank account in Nigeria. When considering opening a bank account, there are other applicable laws. For instance, pursuant to the <strong><em>Central Bank of Nigeria (Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism in Banks and Other Financial Institutions in Nigeria) Regulations, 2013</em></strong>, most commercial banks now mandate all foreigners to obtain an Expatriate Quota through the company and Work Permit (CERPAC) before they can be eligible to be a signatory to a bank account in Nigeria.</li>
</ol>
<p>In closing, it is important to strictly comply with the above tips for a seamless registration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CAC SHARE CAPITAL THRESHOLD FOR COMPANY REGISTRATION ON NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>Persons interested in registering a company in certain industries and economic sectors in Nigeria are required by statutes and other regulations to have a minimum share capital threshold before such a company can be registered and deemed eligible to carry on business in those industries. The essence of this requirement is to determine the viability of the company as these industries are usually capital-intensive ventures and highly regulated.</p>
<p>Below is a list of these various industries and their requisite share capital threshold before they can be registered with CAC.</p>

<p>Furthermore, where a foreigner is to participate in a company, either as a shareholder and/or director, the Federal Ministry of Interior mandates such company to have a minimum share capital of N10,000,000 (Ten Million Naira) to make such company eligible to apply for and obtain expatriate quota, as well as business permit. Consequently, the  CAC requires companies with foreign participation to have at least N10,000,000 (Ten Million Naira) share capital before such a company can be registered.</p>
<p>Conclusively, certain industries mandates proposed participants to obtain an Approval-in-Principle from industry regulators before they can register a company in that industry with CAC. Such industries include banking, and payment service provides among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A tech company intending to carry out technological operations in Nigeria is required to be registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), which is the principal regulatory body that regulates the registration of all business structures in Nigeria. There are different business structures available to register a tech company in Nigeria and each business structure has its benefits attached. The type of business structure that is recommended for a tech company is a company limited by shares.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private Company Limited by Shares</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A suitable business structure that a tech business can be registered under is a private company limited by shares. Registering as a company is the most appropriate vehicle to register a technological company because of the benefits attached. a company has a distinct separate legal personality from its owners as the company can be held liable for any action or omissions that arise from its operations, it enjoys perpetual succession and with the ability to sue and be sued in its own name.</p>
<p>To register a tech company with the CAC and commence business operations, there are prescribed procedures and documents to be complied with before it can be successfully registered.</p>
<p>The following are the requirements to register a tech company with the CAC</p>
<ul>
<li>Two (2) options for the proposed company name.</li>
<li>The objectives of the company.</li>
<li>The address of the company.</li>
<li>The share capital and shareholding formula among shareholders of the company.</li>
<li>The particulars of a minimum of two (2) Directors with valid means of identification such as identification card, national ID, drivers’ license, or international passport.</li>
<li>Particulars of the shareholders of the company and their means of identification.</li>
<li>The memorandum and Articles of association of the company.</li>
<li>Evidence of payment of the prescribed application fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon incorporation of the tech company with the CAC, the company obtains a unique tax identification number (TIN) and also registers for Value Added Tax (VAT) with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). The TIN is used for the payment of applicable taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Registration with other Regulatory Agencies</strong></p>
<p>It is important to state that registering the tech company with the CAC may not be the final step for setting up a tech company in Nigeria. There are other regulatory agencies that a tech company is to be registered with before commencing operations in the technology industry. Some of the relevant regulatory agencies are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTAP is a regulatory agency that regulates the transfer of foreign technology into Nigeria. It requires the registration of technology transfer agreements in sectors such as finance and insurance, manufacturing, franchising, technical services, management services, technical know-how, oil and gas, civil construction and power and energy, etc.</p>
<p>Requirements for the registration of a tech company with NOTAP are as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy of the duly completed application form.</li>
<li>Certificate of Incorporation with the Corporate Affairs Commission.</li>
<li>Memorandum and Article of Association of the company.</li>
<li>A duly completed TAA Pre-Qualification Form.</li>
<li>Tax Payer Identification Number (TIN).</li>
<li>A draft copy of the Technology Transfer Agreement to be registered.</li>
<li>A copy of the duly completed NOTAP questionnaires for different sectors.</li>
<li>A duly completed copy of the Monitoring Form.</li>
<li>A copy of the feasibility study report of the company.</li>
<li>Annual audited accounts for the preceding three years.</li>
<li>Evidence of tax payment for the preceding three years.</li>
<li>Profile of the technical partner.</li>
<li>Performance bond for advanced payment.</li>
<li>A comprehensive training program, which must include staff, skills or knowledge to be acquired.</li>
<li>Approval or licenses obtained from the relevant authorities and bodies such as the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) for agreements on communication etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Information Technology Development Agency ((NITDA)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The NITDA plays a vital role in the technology industry as it is charged with the responsibility of planning, researching, regulating, monitoring, evaluating<strong>, </strong>and verifying the progress made in the information technology practice, activities, and systems in the Nigerian economy. Every tech company (information technology service providers/consultants) and contracts to Ministries, Departments, and Agencies of the Federal Government are required to be registered with the NITDA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registration with Nigeria Telecommunication License (NCC)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on specific services a tech company intends to engage, a registered tech company may also be required to obtain from the NCC. A tech company willing to carry out any services relating to telecommunication or value-added services (VAS) is mandated to obtain a license from the NCC.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The technology industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in Nigeria. A tech company must first be registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) as the certificate obtained will be required to register with any other relevant technology sector regulatory agencies if required.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A private lending company is a company engaged in consumer and commercial money lending operations in Nigeria. This means the business of giving customers a loan with the agreement that it will be paid at a later agreed date with interest rates accrued on it. Private lending companies are subject to the regulation of the Money Lending Law of the various states of the Federation. <strong>Section 2</strong> of the Money Lending Law states that <strong><em>“Money Lending includes every person whose business is that of money lending or who carries out or advertises or announces himself or holds himself to anyway as carrying on business, whether or not he also possesses or owns property or money derived from sources other than the lending of money and whether or not he carries on businesses as a principal or agent”.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>How to Start a Private Lending Company</strong></p>
<p>The first step to consider is to register the private lending company with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). With the registration, the private lending company can open a corporate account with any bank in Nigeria for business purposes. Registering the company and having a corporate account builds the credibility of the private lending company and can boost the chances of attracting investors and clients to the company.</p>
<p>The next step is to obtain the required money lending license from the government issuing authority to operate a private lending company. Only companies licensed as money lending businesses are permitted to legitimately engage in lending operations in Nigeria.</p>
<p><strong>Application Process for Money Lending License</strong></p>
<p>The steps to apply for Money Lending License to legally operate a private lending company must be strictly adhered to before Money Lending License can be granted.</p>
<p>The proposed private lending company must make a formal application to the Chief Magistrate within the jurisdiction where the business is to operate. The application is to be made on the company’s letterhead with the Company’s seal affixed to it.</p>
<p>The application for a Money Lending License in Lagos State is to be accompanied by the following documents;</p>
<ul>
<li>A cover letter with the company’s seal attached.</li>
<li>The office address of the individual or corporate applicant.</li>
<li>Certificate of Incorporation of the Company.</li>
<li>Certified True Copy of the CAC application Forms.</li>
<li>Memorandum and Articles of Association of the proposed lending company. The object clause of the company must include money lending business or financial service.</li>
<li>Tax Clearance of the proposed private lending company. Where the proposed private lending company is newly registered, there must be evidence that the company is a registered taxpayer.</li>
<li>Police clearance from the Commissioner of Police for two (2) directors of the proposed private lending company.</li>
<li>Evidence of maintaining an office by the proposed private lending company.</li>
<li>Evidence of maintenance of a current account with a recognized licensed bank.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon application to the Chief Magistrate, the proposed private lending company will be issued a Form B and C. After obtaining the required Forms, the proposed private lending company is to further make a formal application to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Tourism.</p>
<p>The application to the Ministry of Home Affairs is to be accompanied by the following additional document:</p>
<ul>
<li>A formal application letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Tourism.</li>
<li>Certificate of Incorporation of the Company.</li>
<li>Evidence of payment of application fee into the Lagos State Government Account.</li>
<li>Money Lending Ordinance (Form B) 19W8, issued from the Magistrate Court.</li>
<li>A duly completed Magistrate Form C.</li>
<li>A police report from the Commissioner of Police showing fingerprints of the Directors of the Company.</li>
<li>3 years Income Tax Clearance for the Directors of the proposed Company.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final stage of the requirement to start a private lending company is the visitation and physical inspection of the intended office by the government officials. Upon visitation, if the company is already involved in lending operations, the books will be inspected too.</p>
<p>Where the statutory requirements have been satisfactory complied with by the proposed private lending company, the Money Lending License will be issued and it lasts for a period of January-December to be renewed annually.</p>
<p>Finally, a private lending company must obtain the required money lending license to legitimately carry on the business of consumer and commercial lending in Nigeria. A money lending company that failed to obtain a required license before carrying on business may be sanctioned by the appropriate authorities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Oil and Gas sector serves as a major source of revenue in Nigeria. Any person intending to start an oil and gas business in Nigeria must comply with certain legal requirements. This write-up will give a breakdown of the step-by-step procedure necessary to set up an oil and gas business in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The following steps must be followed to start an oil and gas company in Nigeria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Registration of Company</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Registration at Corporate Affairs Commission</strong></p>
<p>This applies to all businesses owned by nationals, foreigners or both. The Companies and Allied Matters requires all businesses to be registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). The process is seamless and carried out online by accredited agents of the CAC. This enables the business to acquire a separate legal entity through which it can sue and be sued and acquire a property. The documents given to the company upon registration ensure legitimacy and builds trust among its customers. They also serve as primary documents requested for during contracts or when opening a bank account. One could also register as an enterprise (business name). However, this would limit the type of permit it can be granted to carry out certain activities in the oil and gas sector.</p>
<p><strong>Registration at National Investment Promotion Commission</strong></p>
<p>This is only required for businesses having foreign participation. Every company with foreign ownership is required by the National Investment Promotion Commission Act to register with the NIPC before commencing business in Nigeria upon incorporation at the CAC.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Tax Registration &amp; Obtaining Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC)</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is pertinent for a company intending to engage in the oil and gas business to register with the nearest branch of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and obtain a Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC). The Tax Clearance Certificate simply proves that the Company’s tax affairs for the preceding year are in order with no outstanding unpaid taxes. One of the benefits of having a TCC is that it is an important requirement to process any permit in the oil and gas industry.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Registration with the Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF)</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This scheme was established to cater to employee’s welfare. It protects private-sector employees from financial difficulties in the event of old age, invalidity, cessation of employment, and death which is paid to them or their survivors. Being a requirement for obtaining a license to operate in the petroleum sector in Nigeria, entities engaged in this business must register with NSITF and make monthly contributions towards the pension or retirement benefits and compensation for other work-related accidents</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Obtain a Permit/License</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Obtain a Department of Petroleum Resources Permit</strong></p>
<p>This is a department under the Ministry of Petroleum Resources (DPR) charged with the responsibility to provide regulatory guidelines across the entire oil and gas value chain in Nigeria. Application for all licenses in the oil and gas sector is sought for and obtained before any person or entity can carry out any operations therein. The DPR issues 3 categories of permits in the Oil &amp; Gas Industry (OGISP) section depending on the service the company intends to provide. The categories of licenses are General, Major and Specialized purpose. The documents required to process the permits include incorporation/registration documents given at the point of Incorporation Documents, Tax Clearance Certificate, Employee Compensation Scheme (NSITF), List of Equipment available to the Company, Details of Staff, Evidence of Medical Retainership with a hospital, Company’s Profile etc.</p>
<p>The documents and the fee charged differ for each category of license sought for.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Register with Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) </u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The NCDMB was established in 2010 by the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Development Act. Registration for the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Joint Qualification System is imperative as it consolidates data on all major activities in the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry. The Board monitors the oil and gas sector to ensure compliance with Nigerian Content provisions and among others targets capacity-building interventions that will deepen indigenous capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Obtain the Industrial Training Fund Certificate </u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The ITF requires employers with a minimum of N50, 000, 000 (Fifty Million Naira) turnover or having more than 5 employees to contribute to the fund at the rate of 1% of the company employees’ payroll. Suppliers, contractors or consultants who bid for contracts from government agencies or private companies are required to make this contribution as well. Thus, a company intending to provide a service in the oil and gas sector must obtain this certificate to evidence its contribution to the fun, which is utilized to promote and encourage the acquisition of skills in industry and commerce with a view of generating a pool of indigenous trained manpower sufficient to meet the growing needs of the economy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Registration for Pension </u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The pension registration can be done with any Pension Fund Administrators (PFA) in Nigeria. Although it is not compulsory unless the company intends to register with the Nigerian Petroleum Exchange or has more than 5 employees. However, it is advisable company register their staff, to enable them to save for pensions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Register with Nigerian Petroleum Exchange and Production Companies </u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Register with Nigerian Petroleum Exchange</strong></p>
<p>This step is not compulsory but advisable if the company intends to participate in bidding platforms for major contracts. This can be avoided if the company only engages in minor contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Register with Production Companies</strong></p>
<p>This is paramount to access the petroleum products intended to be sold and work with the major oil-producing companies, especially the International Oil Companies (IOC). The production companies include Total, Shell, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, there are various business opportunities in the oil and gas sector that one can engage in, depending on one&#8217;s capital or expertise. Regardless, to engage in any oil and gas activities in Nigeria, it is advisable to register an entity first, and when a company has been registered, it is mandatory to obtain appropriate licensing from the <a href="https://www.dpr.gov.ng/index.php">DPR</a> and any other relevant regulatory agencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>How To Register LLP in Nigeria</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Limited Liability Partnership in Nigeria</strong></p>
<p>A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is one of the laudable innovations of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020. It is essentially a fusion of the features of a partnership and a company where a group of individuals can pool resources together to establish a business and have their liability limited similar to that of shareholders in an incorporated company, as opposed to a general partnership where liabilities were not limited.</p>
<p>Part C, Sections 746-788 of CAMA 2020 introduces LLP. For persons intending to engage in a partnership, this presents an opportunity to do so and acquire the benefits of being regarded as a separate legal entity that can sue and be sued in its name, acquire, own, hold, develop and dispose-off immovable or movable property, have a common seal (optional) and perform any other acts a body corporate may engage in lawfully.</p>
<p>The following are the procedure and requirements to register an LLP in Nigeria:</p>
<p><strong><u>Step 1 &#8211; Reservation of Name</u></strong></p>
<p>The first step is to reserve the name of the proposed LLP. Two (2) names are usually requested to determine the availability of either and approve One (1) for onward use to carry out registration. An availability code is given upon approval.</p>
<p><strong><u>Step 2 – Registration</u></strong></p>
<p>The availability code gives access and upon payment of the required fee to the form, CAC/LLP 01 (Application to Register a Limited Liability Partnership). The following details are required to be provided.</p>
<ul>
<li>Approved LLP name</li>
<li>Details of at least 2 partners</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Details of at least 2 designated partners, one of whom must be resident in Nigeria.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Description of business activity</li>
<li>Details of verifiable registered address and address of the head office (if different from registered address), company’s email and phone number</li>
<li>Details of members (individual or corporate)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Details of Person with Significant Control (one who directly or indirectly has at least 5% of interest, voting rights in the partnership, can remove or appoint a majority of partners and exercise any significant control over the affairs of the company.</li>
<li>Contribution of each member to the partnership.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Partnership Agreement</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 788 CAMA 2020 further recognizes the operation of a foreign LLP, which must be registered if it intends to carry on business in Nigeria. However, the Minister has the power to grant an exemption. Regulation 22 of the Companies Registration, 2020 states that a foreign LLP may apply to the Minister for exemption if it is:</p>
<ol>
<li>An LLP invited to Nigeria by or with the approval of the Federal Government to execute any specified individual project.</li>
<li>An LLP in Nigeria for the execution of specific individual loan projects on behalf of a donor country or international organization.</li>
<li>LLP owned by a foreign government and engaged solely in export promotion activities.</li>
<li>An engineering and technical expert engaged on any individual specialist project under contract with any of the governments in the Federation or any of their agencies or with any other body or person, where such contract has been approved by the Federal Government.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, prior to the introduction of LLP by CAMA 2020, businesses that intend to take the form of a partnership could only register as business names, and while this reduced cost of registration and tax liability, the partners&#8217; personal assets were unprotected from liability. The Partnership Law of Lagos State 2009, however, provided the opportunity albeit only within the territory of Lagos to further register as an LLP. However, with this innovation, any business in Nigeria can register as an LLP.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Bureau De Change (BDC) sector has remained an important unit of the Nigerian financial market playing a crucial role in exchange rate stability and job creation. It is a business where people exchange currency for another. This business has been defined by the Central Bank of Nigeria Manual to mean a retail foreign exchange dealer carrying on the business of Personal Travel Allowance (PTA), Business Travel Allowance, and also inward and outward transfer. It is a company that is licensed to carry out small-scale foreign exchange services in Nigeria and whose sole object is the carrying on of such business on a standalone basis.</p>
<p>A bureau de change is a viable business making its profit by buying foreign currency and then selling the same currency at a higher exchange rate or by charging commissions or fees. It is most times called foreign exchange or currency exchange which is indeed seen as a crucial part of international travel. Below are the procedures and requirements for applying for a BDC license in Nigeria</p>
<p><strong>APPLICATION FOR BDC LICENCE</strong></p>
<p>It is noteworthy that applying for a license is always in two stages, namely; Approval-in-Principle (AIP) and Final License. It is indispensable that a formal application is made to the <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/">Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)</a> Governor before promoters can be granted Approval in Principle to carry on the business of a BDC. However, some documents need to be attached to this application form such as the financial requirements, a feasibility report, a copy of the draft Memorandum and Articles of Association, a letter of intent, and personal information of the proposed shareholders.</p>
<p>Before a proposed BDC registers its name with the Corporate Affairs Commission, an approval-in-principle must have been obtained from the CBN because this will be presented to CAC for the BDC company registration. The Approval-in-Principle is not the approval for the commencement of business, as further steps need to be taken.</p>
<p>Consequently, the promoter of a proposed BDC is expected to submit an application for a final license six months after the grant of Approval-in-Principle.</p>
<p><strong>FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SETTING UP A BDC</strong></p>
<p>The financial requirements for setting up a BDC are as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimum paid-up share capital of N35 Million</li>
<li>A non-refundable application fee of N150,000</li>
<li>A non-refundable licensing fee of N1 Million</li>
<li>A Mandatory caution deposit of N35 Million</li>
<li>Registration cost of N35 Million share capital company with CAC (fee can be negotiated with a CAC Agent)</li>
<li>A non-refundable change of name fee of N150,000 (where applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BOARD/ MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>It is stipulated in the CBN revised guidelines for BDC operators that the minimum number of the board of directors is three while the maximum is five which is subject to the approval of the CBN.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATION OF A BUREAU DE CHANGE </strong></p>
<p>The affairs of a BDC in Nigeria are strictly to deal with banknotes and coins, plastic cards and other activities, as the CBN may approve from time to time. When it comes to dealing in foreign currencies by a BDC, these currencies are to be derived from private sources and other sources provided by the CBN for the purpose of funding Business Travel Allowance and Personal Travel Allowance.</p>
<p>Also, it is pivotal that every BDC keeps proper registers and records of all transactions for transparency and compliance with Anti Money Laundering Provisions, CBN Guidelines, Circulars or directives.  Furthermore, the arrival amount sold to or bought from a customer should be issued by a BDC through a machine list or receipts.</p>
<p><strong>NON-PERMISSIBLE ACTIVITIES</strong></p>
<p>A licensed BDC is not permitted from engaging in the following activities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dealing in offshore business or maintaining foreign correspondence relationship.</li>
<li>Dealing in any trade-related import activities.</li>
<li>Maintaining a foreign account in whatever form.</li>
<li>Street trading of foreign exchange.</li>
<li>Carrying on capital market activities and other activities that may be termed non-permissible by the CBN.</li>
</ol>
<p>In closing, it is a law that a Bureau De Change is authorized and empowered as a unit institution and it is not permitted to have a branch office outside its registered office. Thus, every BDC must comply with the requirements of the Foreign Exchange (Monitoring &amp; Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995, Monetary Policy Guidelines, the provisions of BOFI Act 2004, Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act 2011, rules and regulations on foreign exchange activities/business and other guidelines issued by the CBN from time to time.</p>
