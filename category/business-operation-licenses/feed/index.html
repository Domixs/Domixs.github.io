										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> FCCPC REGISTRATION FOR DIGITAL LENDING COMPANIES</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) is the regulatory authority responsible for, among other things, the administration and enforcement of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2018 (the Act).  Recently the FCCPC, NITDA (National Information Technology Development Agency) together with other federal agencies have been looking into the activities of digital lending companies in Nigeria pertaining to infringements of the privacy of their customers and shaming of their debtors.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://fccpc.gov.ng/">FCCPC</a> first issued orders to multiple financial institutions freezing or suspending operations of certain accounts, which some of the money lenders have used to conduct business transactions subject to investigation.</p>
<p>The FCCPC has now laid down interim guidelines and regulations to regulate digital money lending organizations, which include that every Digital Lending organization now has to register with the FCCPC.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements for FCCPC Registration for Digital Lending Companies</strong></p>
<p>The following are the requirements for registration with the FCCPC by digital lending companies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Certified copy of the certificate of incorporation of the applicant.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A brief description of the business of the applicant and where relevant, their groups.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Organogram showing role players and location of key role players and any operational approving authorities/person.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Name and address of a person within the business who is authorized to accept all correspondence and accept service on behalf of the business.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Evidence of membership in any trade or professional associates.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Any service level agreements with any service providers with respect to the operation but excluding administration.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Evidence of feedback and complaint resolution mechanism.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Terms of use of the business of the applicant.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Privacy policy of the applicant.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Evidence of data auditing compliance and data auditing report submitted to the Nigerian Data Protection Bureau</strong></li>
<li><strong>Evidence of tax payments or tax waivers where applicable.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Money lending license.</strong></li>
<li><strong>All applicable fees associated with service.</strong></li>
<li><strong>FCCPC INTERIM DIGITAL LENDING GUIDELINES FORM 002 – a declaration for Digital Lending Businesses in Nigeria.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is worthy of note that the obligation to comply with the FCCPC regulations &amp;guidelines is mandatory before any digital lending company can operate in Nigeria. A lending company found dodging or circumventing the FCCPC guidelines may be restricted from carrying on business operations in Nigeria apart from the likely prosecution of the director(s) of such a company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Money laundering is the process of concealing the origin of money, obtained from illicit activities such as drug trafficking, corruption, and embezzlement by converting it into a legitimate source. It is a crime in many jurisdictions with varying definitions. It is usually a key operation of organized crime.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, the Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act of 2022 was passed into Law in the month of May 2022 to set standards and promote the effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering. The new Act has made an improvement on the earlier Act of 2011.</p>
<p>In this write-up, we shall briefly discuss the relevant provisions of the new Act below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Limit</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Section 2 of the Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022 provides;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>(1) No person or body corporate shall, except in a transaction through a financial institution, make or accept cash payment of a sum exceeding— </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(a) N5,000,000 or its equivalent, in the case of an individual; or </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(b) N10,000,000 or its equivalent, in the case of a body corporate. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(2) A person shall not conduct two or more transactions separately with one or more financial institutions or designated non-financial businesses and professions with intent to— </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(a) avoid the duty to report a transaction which should be reported under this Act; and </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(b) breach the duty to disclose information under this act by any other means. </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li> As seen from the provision above, the cash limit permissible for an individual to make or accept is the sum of N5,000,000(Five Million Naira) or its equivalent and N10,000,000(Ten Million Naira) or its equivalent in the case of a body corporate. Such transactions are to be routed through a financial institution, and any lodgment of funds in excess of N5,000,000 (Five Million Naira) and N10,000,000(Ten Million Naira) for individuals and body corporate respectively, must be reported by the banks within seven days.</li>
<li><strong>Splits</strong>: Subsection 2 above prohibits a situation where a person splits a single transaction into two or more separate transactions with the intent to avoid the reporting of such transaction.</li>
<li>Section 3 of the Act provides that the international transfer of funds or securities to or from a foreign country exceeding $10,000(Ten Thousand Dollars) is to be reported within one day of the transaction. Funds refer to assets of every kind whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, howsoever acquired and legal documents or instruments in any form, including electronic or digital, evidencing title to or interest in such assets, including bank credits, travellers’ cheques, bank cheques, money orders, shares, securities, bonds, drafts or letters of credit and virtual assets. Virtual assets, on the other hand, mean a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or investment purposes but do not include digital representations of fiat currencies, securities and other financial assets.</li>
<li><strong>Know Your Customer (KYC):</strong> For the purpose of carrying out the purport of this law, in Section 4 of the Act, financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions must conduct due diligence and identification of their customers particularly persons alleging to act on behalf of its customers. Designated non-financial businesses and professions include (a) automotive dealers, (b) businesses involved in the hospitality industry, (c) casinos, (d) clearing and settlement companies, (e) consultants and consulting companies, (f ) dealers in jewelries, (g) dealers in mechanised farming equipment, farming equipment and machineries, (h) dealers in precious metals and precious stones, (i) dealers in real estate, estate developers, estate agents and brokers (j) high value dealers, (k) hotels, (l) legal practitioners and notaries, (m) licensed professional accountants, (n) mortgage brokers, (o) practitioners of mechanised farming, (p) supermarkets, (q) tax consultants, (r) trust and company service providers, (s) pools betting, or (t) such other businesses and professions as may be designated by the Minister responsible for Trade and Investment.</li>
<li>The law provides for 24-hour timeframes for all financial institutions or designates non-financial institutions to file suspicious transaction reports with the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) which is the central unit responsible for receiving, requesting, analyzing and disseminating to the competent authorities disclosures of financial information concerning the suspected proceeds of crime and potential financing of terrorism. With regards to this reporting, section 7 provides thus:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Where a transaction— (a) involves a frequency which is unjustifiable or unreasonable, (b) is surrounded by conditions of unusual or unjustified complexity, (c) appears to have no economic justification or lawful objective, (d) is inconsistent with the known transaction pattern of the account or business relationship, or (e) in the opinion of the financial institution or non-financial business and profession involves the proceeds of a criminal activity, unlawful act, money laundering or terrorist financing, that transaction shall be deemed to be suspicious and the financial institution and designated non-financial business and profession involved in the transaction shall report to the Unit as the case may be immediately. (2) A financial institution or designated non-financial business and profession shall within 24 hours after the transaction referred to in subsection (1).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Act further spells out the punishment for failure to report and/or make a disclosure of acts of money laundering. Section 11 of the Act provides that any financial institution or designated non-financial business and profession that contravenes the provisions commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of at least N250,000 and not more than N1,000,000 for each day the contravention continues. Also, Legal professional privilege and the invocation of client confidentiality shall not apply in connection with— (a) the purchase or sale of property; (b) the purchase or sale of any business; (c) the managing of client money, securities or other assets; (d) the opening or management of bank, savings or securities accounts; (d) the creation, operation or management of trusts, companies or similar structures; or (e) anything produced in furtherance of any unlawful act.</li>
<li>The law prohibits the opening or maintaining of numbered or anonymous accounts by any person, financial institution or body corporate. The operation of and establishment of a shell bank in Nigeria is also prohibited. A shell bank means a bank that is not physically located in the country in which it is incorporated and licensed, and which is unaffiliated with a regulated financial group that is subject to effective consolidated supervision. Any person, financial institution or body corporate that contravenes the provisions commits an offence and is liable to conviction to, in the case of an individual, a term of imprisonment of at least two years but not more than five years or in the case of a financial institution or body corporate, a fine of at least N10,000,000 but not more than N50,000,000, in addition, there shall be the prosecution of the principal officers of the body corporate and the winding up and prohibition of its constitution or incorporation under any form or guise.</li>
<li>Furthermore, financial institutions and non-designated financial businesses and professions must create mechanisms for determining whether a customer or a customer’s beneficiary is a politically exposed person. The Act defines politically exposed persons to include (a) individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example Heads of State or Government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of State-owned corporations and important political party officials, (b) individuals who are or have been entrusted domestically with prominent public functions, for example Heads of State or of Government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of State-owned corporations and important political party officials, and (c) persons who are or have been entrusted with a prominent function by an international organisation and includes members of senior management such as directors, deputy directors and members of the board or equivalent functions and their family members and close associates, other than middle ranking or more junior individuals in the foregoing categories.</li>
<li><strong>Registration with SCUML:</strong> The new Act makes it mandatory for all non-designated financial institutions to register with the SCUML and make various statutory reports as provided by the Act.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>CONCLUSION </u></strong></p>
<p>Conclusively, the new Act seeks to remedy the lacuna that the former Act created. Based on the key provisions above, an individual and body corporate who makes or accepts transactions exceeding the amount stipulated in the Act commits an offence and is liable to punishment as prescribed.</p>
<p>The Act further seeks to put financial institutions on their feet in the discharge of their duties by placing a timeframe within which to report any suspicious transactions and failure to do so attracts a penalty as discussed above.</p>
<p>It suffices to say that the new Act does not encourage lackadaisical attitudes from persons or corporate bodies involved in any financial transaction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) of Nigeria has recently released new rules regarding the issuance, exchange and custody of digital assets (i.e digital token that represents assets such as debt or equity claim on the issuer) in Nigeria. Digital assets here refer to all types of crypto assets.</p>
<p>The rules shall apply to all issuers seeking to raise capital through digital asset offerings.</p>
<p>The new rules for digital assets are part of the SEC&#8217;s effort to regulate digital assets such as BITCOINS and NFTs.</p>
<p>The new rules cover the issuance of digital assets as securities, the registration of platforms and digital asset custodians, exchanges and virtual assets service providers.</p>
<p>In 2020, CBN directed financial service providers to halt cryptocurrency transactions, but SEC&#8217;s new regulations mandate the registration of the offering and sale of digital tokens that are considered securities.</p>
<p>It is crucial that SEC tackles the growing cases of crypto scams and dubious entities taking advantage of Nigerian investors in the crypto market. The crypto market is volatile, so this new regulation on the National level may bring about structure and stability to the market.</p>
<p>The new SEC&#8217;s regulations cover 5 major items ranging from issuance of digital assets to rules that govern digital asset exchanges in the country.</p>
<p>In the new guidelines, SEC requires crypto issuers or sponsors to register their digital assets with the commission. The issuers are also required to make an initial assessment filing with it to prove that the assets they issue are securities, followed by filing for proper registration.</p>
<p>According to the new guidelines, those that have already issued assets or engaged in “Initial Coin Offering (ICO) will be given 3 months to comply with the stated registration requirements.”</p>
<p>Every individual or corporate organization which engages in any aspect of Blockchain-related and digital asset services must register with the SEC and follow its regulatory guidelines.</p>
<p>The Regulations provide that: “Such services include, but are not limited to reception, transmission and execution of orders on behalf of other persons, dealers on own account, portfolio management, investment advice, custodian or nominee services.”.</p>
<p>SEC stated that it might require foreign or non-resident startups or companies to establish a branch in Nigeria, adding that foreign entities will be recognized if they belong to a country that either has a reciprocal agreement with Nigeria or is a member of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).</p>
<p>With the new guidelines, SEC mandates entities seeking to offer any kind of crypto products and services in Nigeria or to Nigerians to secure a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license.</p>
<p>This is besides relevant category licenses, implying that an exchange would need a digital asset exchange license in addition to the VASP permit.</p>
<p>The VASP license has underlining obligations, including a requirement that license holders should obtain self-declared risk acknowledgement forms from users while also issuing a disclaimer that losses from investments are not covered by any protection fund.</p>
<p>VASPs are also required to employ anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards.</p>
<p>Apart from the VASP rules, the new SEC rules cover areas such as operating a digital asset exchange, token issuance, operating digital assets offering platform, and requirements for digital asset custodians. Under the new guidelines, all crypto exchangers providing service to Nigerians are now required to secure a permit, which mandates the commission to have access to their records. Such exchanges are also expected to submit weekly and monthly trading information as well as quarterly and annual financial and compliance reports.</p>
<p>The new rule restrains an exchange from facilitating the trading of any digital asset unless SEC has first issued a “no objection” about such asset. This implies that an exchange will need to submit applications for every asset it intends to list, and the application should prove that the exchange has sufficient information about the project and its associated risks.</p>
<p>The new guidelines stated that the SEC will allow projects to raise up to N10 billion — based on the official exchange rate.</p>
<p>On token issuance, the SEC states that any project seeking to conduct initial coin offerings within Nigeria or targeting Nigerians must register its intent with the Commission by filing an assessment form and submitting a detailed copy of its whitepaper.</p>
<p>Should the SEC consider the proposed token security, the issuer has to comply with the country’s securities laws.</p>
<p>According to SEC, a DAOP operator must of necessity conduct due diligence on any project seeking to offer digital assets through its platform and exercise its judgment on whether the project is fit to raise funds.</p>
<p>SEC postulates a review of applications within 30days before determining if the digital asset proposed to be offered constitutes a &#8220;security&#8221;.</p>
<p>According to the commission, the new guidelines shall apply to all issuers seeking to raise capital through digital asset offerings, adding that it provides that issuers may only raise funds within a limit of N10 billion.</p>
<p>The commission, however, added that it could adjust the ceiling from time to time.</p>
<p>It revealed that digital asset actors include Digital Asset Offering Platforms (DAOPs), Digital Asset Custodians (DACs), Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs), and Digital Assets Exchange (DAX).</p>
<p>According to the new regulation, SEC said it would accommodate DAOPs provided it tendered evidence of a minimum paid-up capital of N500 million and a current fidelity bond covering at least 25 per cent of the minimum paid-up capital.</p>
<p>The regulation requires applicants seeking to register a DAOP to pay NGN100,000 for the filing or application fee, NGN300,000 for the processing fee, NGN30 million for the registration fee, and NGN100,000 for sponsored individuals.</p>
<p>Despite the SEC&#8217;s new regulations, it is still not certain whether Nigeria is ready to fully regulate cryptocurrency activities. This is because the Nigerian apex bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has continued to mandate all financial institutions in Nigeria to steer clear of cryptocurrencies and should not allow any crypto-related entities to open bank accounts in financial institutions, this has pushed virtually all individuals engaging in cryptocurrency activities in Nigeria to engage only in what is known as peer-to-peer trading. However, it is expected that the new SEC regulations may force the CBN to reconsider its stance on cryptocurrency transactions in the near future.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO START A BUSINESS IN NIGERIA </strong></p>
<p>In Nigeria, foreign investments have been a great boost to the economy. It is to be noted that Nigeria operates a free market economy hence, there are no restrictions on foreigners starting a business in Nigeria subject to the fulfilment of certain requirements.</p>
<p>We shall briefly explain the main requirements and steps by which a foreigner can invest or start a business in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The following are key steps a foreigner wishing to establish a business in Nigeria must follow.</p>
<ol>
<li>Incorporation/Registration of a business</li>
<li>Registration with Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission(NIPC)</li>
<li>Approval for Business Permits</li>
<li>Immigration Requirements and Residence Permit(CERPAC)/ Application for Expatriate Quota</li>
<li>Bank Account Opening</li>
<li>Procurement of Certificate of Capital Importation</li>
<li>Taxation Registration</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us briefly discuss the above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>INCORPORATION OF A BUSINESS</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is instructive to note that only registered businesses in Nigeria are recognized by law to lawfully carry-on business in Nigeria save for a few exemptions. A foreigner who seeks to commence business in Nigeria must register the same; the agency in charge of business registration is the Corporate Affairs Commission. The Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020 (“CAMA”) puts this in proper perspective as it provides in Section 78 as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Subject to sections 80 &#8211; 83 of this Act, every foreign company which before or after the commencement of this Act was incorporated outside Nigeria, and having the intention of carrying on business in Nigeria, shall take all steps necessary to obtain incorporation as a separate entity in Nigeria for that purpose, but until so incorporated, the foreign company shall not carry on business in Nigeria or exercise any of the powers of a registered company and shall not have a place of business or an address for service of documents or processes in Nigeria for any purpose other than the receipt of notices and other documents, as matters preliminary to incorporation under this Act.</strong> </em></li>
</ul>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>The Act also stipulates the types of business in which a person including a foreigner can be involved and they include a Limited Liability Company, an Unlimited Liability Company and a Company Limited by Guarantee.</p>
<p>A foreigner can also enter into a partnership with a Nigerian to form a business. This partnership arrangement may be limited or unlimited. A limited partnership is where a partner’s liability is limited to the value of capital contributed to form the business or unlimited where the partners’ liabilities are not limited.</p>
<p>In registering a business, Section 852 of CAMA provides a guide as to the types of names a company can be registered with.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above already stated, section 80 of CAMA provides that a foreign company may be exempted from the registration upon certain grounds.</p>
<p>Section 80 provides as follows:</p>
<p><em>  <strong>       (1) A foreign company may apply to the Minister for exemption from the provisions of section 78 of this Act if that foreign company belongs to one of the following categories, that is— (a) foreign companies other than those specified in paragraph (d), invited to Nigeria by or with the approval of the       Federal Government to execute any specified individual project; (b) foreign companies which are in Nigeria for the execution of specific individual loan projects on behalf of a donor country or international organisation; (c)    foreign government-owned companies engaged solely in export promotion activities; and (d) engineering consultants and technical experts engaged on any individual specialist project under contract with any of the governments in the Federation or any of their agencies or with any other body or person,  where such contract has been approved by the Federal Government.</strong></em></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong><u>REGISTRATION WITH THE NIGERIAN INVESTMENT PROMOTION COMMISSION (NIPC)</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>NIPC is an agency of the Federal Government saddled with the responsibility of coordinating and monitoring all foreign investments activities in Nigeria. The Federal Government of Nigeria, has tasked the investment promotion agency with attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) over the years.</p>
<p>The Commission initiates and supports measures which shall enhance the investment climate in Nigeria for both Nigerian and non-Nigerian investors.</p>
<p>Registration with the NIPC is compulsory for all foreigners intending to carry out business in Nigeria. Upon receipt of registration forms, the NIPC within fourteen working days will register the business after being satisfied with the relevant documents. The registration with NIPC guarantee foreign investments in Nigeria from expropriation.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong><u>BUSINESS PERMITS FROM MINISTR OF INTERIOR</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A business permit is a document issued by the Federal Ministry of Interior through the Department of Citizenship and Business. This document allows for the operation of businesses in Nigeria by foreigners. The importance of this permit is that it ensures that foreign companies are not edging out Nigerian organizations with businesses that domestic companies already engage in.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Section 36 of the Immigration Act, it provides that <em>no person other than a Nigerian citizen shall, on his own account or in partnership with any other person, practice a profession or establish or take over any trade or business whatsoever or register or take over any company with limited liability for any purpose without the written consent of the Minister of Internal Affairs.</em></p>
<p>It must be known that a business permit is required where the company is entirely owned by the foreigners or where a foreign entity is engaging in a joint venture with a Nigerian Corporation.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>IMMIGRATION REQUIREMENTS AND RESIDENCE PERMIT (CERPAC)/EXPARTRIATE QUOTA</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Combined Expatriate Residence Permit and Aliens Card (CERPAC) is the official name for the Residence and Work Permit in Nigeria. It is a card issued to an expatriate or foreigner allowing him to live and work in Nigeria for a specified period of time. In Nigeria, the Comptroller General of Immigration is empowered to issue a Nigerian residence permit under the watch of the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<p>An Expatriate Quota, on the other hand, is an approval granted to companies to employ the services of foreigners with relevant skills with a view to transferring the same to Nigerian understudies. It states the number of foreigners allowed to work in the company and this is done to check the indiscriminate employment of foreigners where there are already competent Nigerians to do the same. Also, it is only granted to registered entities.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>BANK ACCOUNT OPENING</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Most foreigners setting up a company in Nigeria often require a bank account opening for ease of doing business, although no law mandates that a foreigner should open a bank account. To open a bank account in Nigeria, all foreigners listed as directors of the company must have to enrol for Bank Verification Number (BVN). Foreigners in overseas can also apply for BVN at designated centres abroad. Regardless of having BVN, the Nigerian banks may demand that any foreigner (either as a director or any other staff) seeking to become a signatory to the bank account must maintain a Nigerian residency status (having CERPAC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>PROCUREMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF CAPITAL IMPORTATION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A Certificate of Capital Importation better known as CCI is a document obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria through the commercial banks. The certificate proves that cash, equipment or a combination of both from foreign investors have been received by an entity incorporated in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The CCI can be gotten from an authorized dealer (commercial banks).</p>
<p>The CCI confers on the foreign investor the right to repatriate capital, dividends and profits at the official foreign exchange market rates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (TIN) &amp; TAX REGISTRATION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Taxes are administered for the running of the government through the different tiers or levels of government. The local councils manage the local government levies, the state taxes are collected by the State Internal Revenue Services, and the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) collect and manage federal taxes. Evading the payment of tax attracts fines and other punitive penalties under Nigerian law. All registered businesses must obtain a TIN upon commencement of business as this unique number enables the payment of taxes. Nowadays, TIN comes with a certificate of incorporation after the company is registered. Apart from having TIN, every registered company within 6 months of incorporation must endeavour to register with the nearby FIRS office to the address of business operation or registered address. Some of the most common taxes payable in Nigeria are Company Income Tax (CIT), Personal Income Tax (otherwise known as PAYE Tax) and Value Added Services on vatable products and services.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>As shown above, Nigeria operates a free-market economy and readily invites foreign investors to bring in their expertise for the growth of the nation’s economy. This is however subject to all procedures and requirements duly complied with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, in a Ruling delivered by Justice Taiwo O. Taiwo on 18<sup>th</sup> October 2021, has held that the Central Bank of Nigeria circular, referenced as BSD/DIR/PUB/LAB/014/001 of February 5, 2021, is not a law and the CBN lacks the requisite authority to declare the trading of Cryptocurrency illegal by a mere circular.</p>
<p>The ruling was delivered pursuant to a motion on notice filed by Risevest Technologies, praying the Honorable Court to discharge an interim freezing order granted by the court on August 17, 2021, in Suit No: FHC/ABJ/CS/822/2021 wherein the Central Bank of Nigeria was the Applicant. The motion sought to vacate an interim order freezing the account of Risevest Technologies and some other persons who had allegedly contravened the CBN Directive contained in the CBN Circular.</p>
<p>The judge pointed out that the CBN had failed to discharge its burden of proof neither did they produce any law that criminalises dealing in cryptocurrency in Nigeria and that the CBN circular, BSD/DIR/PUB/LAB/014/001 dated February 5, 2021 is not a law and therefore, the trading of cryptocurrency cannot be held to be illegal based on a mere circular.</p>
<p>The learned Jurist in delivering his ruling held inter alia as follows:</p>
<p><strong> “I have perused the counter affidavit of the Respondent and I see that the reason for freezing the account of the applicant is based on the alleged infraction of the circular of the CBN.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The law is trite that any conduct that must be sanctioned must be expressly stated in a written law.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Being unknown to law, circulars cannot create an offence because it was not shown to have been issued under an Order, Act, Law or Statute.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The learned counsel for the respondent has also raised the issue of public policy in his submissions against the application.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Can this court decide this application based on public policy as being urged on it by the learned counsel for the respondent? I think not.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“I hereby discharge the interim freezing order of this court made on August 17, 2021, made against the defendant/ applicant.”</strong></p>
<p>The decision of the Honorable Court is in line with Section 36(12) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) which states that:</p>
<p><strong><em>“Subject as otherwise provided by this Constitution a person shall not be convicted of a criminal offence unless that offence is defined and the penalty therefore is prescribed by a written law; and in this subsection, a written law refers to an Act of the National Assembly or a Law of a State, and subsidiary  legislation or instrument under the provisions of the law.”</em></strong></p>
<p>The implication of this ruling is that cryptocurrency trading in Nigeria as it stands is not an illegal or prohibited venture unless and until a law to criminalise it is enacted or this decision of the court is overturned on appeal to a higher court.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Generator importation requires an import permit from the Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC).</p>
<p>The Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) is an independent regulatory body with the authority to supervise Nigeria&#8217;s electricity industry</p>
<p>The main purpose of establishing NERC is to supervise the electricity prices of government-owned or controlled power generation companies and any other power generation companies that have power generation, transmission, and power distribution licenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>THE IMPORTATION OF ELECTRIC POWER GENERATOR</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Every individual seeking to import an electric power generator must obtain a clearance certificate for the importation and follow the guidelines as prescribed by NERC.</p>
<p>The NERC is empowered by <strong>Section 32(1)(e), 96(1) &amp; (2)(q) of the Electric Power Reform Act, 2005</strong> to make guidelines for the importation of power generators into Nigeria.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GUIDELINES FOR IMPORTATION OF GENERATORS INTO NIGERIA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The following are the steps to be followed for the importation of generating sets into Nigeria following the NERC guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>An application for the Clearance Certificate must be made in writing in a manner specified and addressed to the NERC. The application could be delivered by hand, sent by mail or through a courier service.</li>
<li>The application shall be signed and dated by the Applicant or his/her authorized agent.</li>
<li>The Application shall contain the following information:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Name of Applicant &amp; Quantity to be imported</li>
<li>Noise level (not more than 35Db) &amp; Pollution control</li>
<li>Make of generators &amp; Technical and Environmental rating</li>
<li>Purpose of importation, Country of origin &amp; Capacity of the generator</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>The application shall be accompanied by the following:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Copy of the Certificate of Incorporation &amp; Tax Clearance certificate for the last three years</li>
<li>VAT registration Certificate &amp; Commercial Invoice/Proforma invoice</li>
<li>Standards Organization of Nigeria Conformity Assessment Programme (SONCAP) &amp; Proof of conformity with extant environmental regulations (emissions, noise etc)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>The application shall be accompanied by the Application fees paid to NERC. Below are the fees payable depending on the size of the generator:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>45 -2.5 KVA – N150.00 Per Unit</li>
<li>5 – 5 KVA &#8211; N250.00 Per Unit</li>
<li>5 -25 KVA – N1,000.00 Per Unit</li>
<li>25 – 100 KVA – N3,500.00 Per Unit</li>
<li>100 KVA – N25,000.00 Per Unit</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>The application fee shall be paid through a bank draft drawn in favour of the “Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission”.</li>
<li>The application fee is non-refundable</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>The application fee is subject to review from time to time as the Commission deems fit.</li>
<li>Upon the submission of the application form and relevant documents and review by the Commission, if satisfied the Applicant shall be issued with the <strong>Clearance Certificate</strong> for the importation of the generator into Nigeria.</li>
<li>The Clearance Certificate issued by the Commission is valid only for six (6) months from the date of issue.</li>
<li>The Clearance Certificate can be renewed for a further period of six (6) months subject to the payment of renewal fees.</li>
<li>The renewal fee is 10% of the fee paid on the Initial Clearance Certificate and the application for renewal shall be within 30 days after the expiration of the Initial Clearance Certificate</li>
<li>The Clearance Certificate is strictly for the importation of generating sets and none other.</li>
<li>The Applicant is expected to submit an annual report of the generating sets imported by him or her every 12 months of importation.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The guidelines as provided for by the NERC must be strictly followed by any individual wishing to import generating sets into Nigeria. Failure to adhere to the strict guidelines would have legal consequences. It must be noted that there is currently a pending bill to completely ban the importation of generating sets in Nigeria before the National Assembly, which has passed the first reading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PROCEDURE FOR NIPC REGISTRATION IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) is a Federal Government Agency in Nigeria established by the NIPC Act 1995. The objective of the NIPC is to promote, coordinate and monitor investments in Nigeria. The commission initiates and supports the enhancement of the investment climate in Nigeria for both Nigerian and Non- Nigerian Investors.</p>
<p>By the combined effect of the Companies and Allied Matters Act with the NIPC Act, a foreigner or foreign company can join in the <a href="https://www.resolutionlawng.com/how-to-register-a-company-in-nigeria-updated-requirements/">formation of a company in Nigeria</a> and enjoy liberal foreign investment protections, assurance and incentives in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Section 20 of the NIPC Act provides that an enterprise in which foreign investment is permitted shall before the commencement of business register with the Commission, but before registration, the enterprise with foreign participation must first be incorporated under the Companies and Allied Matters Act. What this implies is that foreigners can invest and participate in the operations of any enterprise in Nigeria except for enterprises that engage with activities in the negative list, which includes; the production of arms and ammunition, the production of narcotic drugs and military wear etc.</p>
<p>When the company has been duly registered with CAC, the next step is to register with the <a href="https://nipc.gov.ng/">NIPC</a>. The registration is done by duly completing the registration form and providing the required documentation and details.</p>
<p>The requirements for registering a registered company with NIPC include the followings:</p>
<ol>
<li>A copy of the Certificate of Incorporation of the company</li>
<li>Memorandum and Article of Association</li>
<li>The CAC Form 1.1, which comprises the details of the company’s shareholding and particulars of the directors.</li>
<li>Particulars of the company</li>
<li>Particulars of shareholders, which will include name, email, phone number and country of residence</li>
<li>Description of business activities</li>
<li>Investment information, which includes the company structure, number of proposed employees, and investment value in USD among others.</li>
<li>Payment of registration fee</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, the NIPC permit is not all that is required for a foreigner to start a business in Nigeria. A company with wholly foreign participation must also obtain a Business Permit and Expatriate quota (where applicable) from the Ministry of Interiors before commencing business operations in Nigeria</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The objective of registering with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission is to receive a permit to operate a company with foreign participation or investment in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The benefits of registering with the NIPC are many for the investors, but the most important one is that the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission Act ensures that no foreign-owned enterprise or establishment shall be expropriated or nationalized by any government in Nigeria after the due registration with the NIPC.</p>
