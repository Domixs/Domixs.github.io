										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NHF CONTRIBUTIONS SCHEME IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>National Housing Funding (NHF) is a Federal Government scheme that entitles Nigerians in paid employment and above 21 years to cater to their housing needs. This scheme was established by the virtue of the NHF Act of 1992.</p>
<p>According to the NHF Act, all Nigerian employees and income earners, whether in paid employment or self-employment, are entitled to the NHF scheme and can register as long as they are 21 years of age. The Act also outlines that registered members should contribute about 2.5% of their basic monthly salary to the Fund through the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN).</p>
<h4><strong>Is NHF compulsory? </strong></h4>
<p>As per the provisions in the NHF Act, all Nigerians in paid employment are obligated to contribute 2.5% of their monthly salary to the National House Fund. Consequently, an employer must deduct 2.5% of the basic salary from the employees and remit it to the FMBN monthly.</p>
<h4><strong>What are the benefits of the NHF scheme? </strong></h4>
<p>The main goal of the NHF scheme is the allocation of funds for the provision of affordable housing for Nigerians. Primarily, it allows a contributor to access a loan for the building, purchasing, or renovation loan for residential accommodation.</p>
<p>Among other benefits a contributor enjoys from the NHF scheme include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced tax liability because contributions to the NHF are tax-deductible</li>
<li>Housing loan of up to 90% of the cost of the house.</li>
<li>Interest on loans remains fixed throughout the life of the mortgage at 6% p.a.</li>
<li>The long period of repayment of up to 30 years.</li>
<li>Contributions can serve as additional old age security.</li>
<li>Up to N15 million can be borrowed.</li>
<li>Refunds with 2% interest on retirement.</li>
<li>Every contributor has a lifetime registration number, a passbook for the personal recording of contributions and an account statement.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the penalty for not contributing to NHF? </strong></h4>
<p><strong>Section 20</strong> of the Act stipulates that Punishments vary depending on the party, as outlined below:</p>
<ol>
<li>A person who prevents or obstructs deduction or remittance of the contribution is guilty under Sec 20 of the Act, guilty of an offence, and liable to a fine of N5, 000 or one-year imprisonment.</li>
<li>An employer who fails to make deductions from his employees&#8217; salaries for NHF contribution or fails to remit the money deducted is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of N50, 000. Also, the individual staff of the employer responsible for making a deduction or remit deduction is exposed to a fine of N20, 000 or imprisonment for five years term or both such fine and imprisonment.</li>
<li>A self-employed person who fails to make a deduction and fails to remit to the bank money for the NHF is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of N5 000 or one-year imprisonment, or both.</li>
</ol>
<p>The institution of proceedings or imposition of a penalty under this section shall not relieve any employer or self-employed person from liability to pay to the bank the money deducted by him for the purpose of the Fund.</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE FOR REGISTRATION WITH NHF</strong></p>
<p>All Nigerians in employment, whether self-employed or in paid employment, are required by the NHF Act to contribute 2.5% of their basic salary/income to the fund. The procedure for registration is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) will supply Employer Registration       Form (NHF1) to employers.</li>
<li>Employers will complete form NHF1 and return to the nearest branch of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria will register the Employer and issue an employer’s registration number.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria will issue form NHF2 to employers for completion by employees or directly to self-employed or individuals.</li>
<li>An employee will complete the form NHF2 and return it to the employer.</li>
<li>The employer or self-employed individuals will return the completed form (NHF2) to the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria will register Employees on Form NHF2 and allocate employees&#8217; participation numbers to each employee/self-employed individual.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank will issue a passbook to each of the registered employees where the monthly deduction of his/her 2.5% basic salary will be posted by the employer.</li>
<li>At this point, an employee is now a registered participant of the National Housing Fund.</li>
<li>Employer will commence the deduction of contributions at source. Such deductions/contributions are remitted to the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria with a schedule of payment indicating the amount contributed by each employee and the period covered.</li>
<li>Self–employed contributors will also commence monthly remittances of contributions to FMBN.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria will accept contributions and issue receipts for payments.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How does one apply for an NHF loan? </strong></h4>
<p>First, the applicant must meet the eligibility requirements on the loan application form, including registering with the NHF scheme. The applicant must be someone who contributed to the Fund at least six months before applying for the loan. Unlike institutional borrowers, individuals cannot apply directly from the FMBN but through a duly licensed and accredited Primary Mortgage Institution (PMI) of their choice. The PMI then forwards the application to the FMBN.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>At its inception, the major goal of NHF was affordable housing to accommodate the Nigerian populace in a suitable environment as the performance of the housing sector is one of the yardsticks for measuring the health of a nation.</p>
<p>Nigeria’s property market faces a paucity of funds, thus a law that mandates every employee to contribute a part of their earnings towards owning a home is important.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, the demand for affordable and befitting housing for citizens far outweighs its supply. NHF, therefore, serves as a contribution towards acquiring an asset, in this case, a home.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LAND TITLES IN LAGOS NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>The first important thing to note is that every land is owned by the state government, this is in accordance with the Land Use Act 1978. The government leases any land purchased for a period of 99 years after which such title can be renewed by the owner. A land can either be free or under government acquisition. A land free from government encumbrances makes it easy to obtain a certificate of occupancy or any type of good land title.</p>
<p>It is important for anyone seeking to purchase real estate to search the title of such property at the appropriate land registry. Each state maintains a land registry where a title to property can be searched. The land title in Lagos State can be searched through the land bureau at Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos. A diligent search for the land title can also involve a search at a court registry where the title to land involves court judgement or probate registry in case of property of a deceased person.</p>
<p>There are two types of acquisitions; Committed and Global.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Committed Acquisition:</strong> Here, the land has registered interest by the government for slated purposes, such as roads, defence purposes, drainages, canals, airports, schools, etc. A person who purchases such land will find the perfection of land title problematic, and where a person proceeds with property development on such land, it can be subject to demolition with no compensation.</li>
<li><strong>Global or Non-Committed Acquisition:</strong> This refers to lands that have been acquired long ago by the government, but the lands have no slated purposes. Such lands can be turned free through the process of ratification.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TYPES OF LAND TITLES IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Excision &amp; Gazette</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Excision simply means the government releasing a parcel of land that has been under global acquisition in the past. A family or an individual interested in such land can process a government-approved excision, and documentation for the land can be processed up to the governor’s consent level.</p>
<p>Gazette is an official record book that spells out all details of an expanse of land that has been excised and given back to the community. The details include the name of the community and details of the expanse of land given excision. The excision document is usually taken to the surveyor general’s office for the land to be gazetted. With a gazette, a person can apply for a certificate of occupancy or governor consent, which is a document granting permission to use and own the land for 99 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Certificate of Occupancy (C of O)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A Certificate of Occupancy is an authorized document of grant issued by the State Government, to an individual, groups of individuals or an entity, to confer ownership and right of occupancy in a definite land for all purposes for a term not exceeding 99 years subject to renewal. The Certificate of Occupancy is a document issued only once, to the first person to own and purchase such land as virgin land. Therefore, this document prevents multiple owners from claiming ownership of that piece of land. The C of O is usually issued for all governments’ land allocations and properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governor’s consent</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Governor’s consent simply refers to the approval of the Governor of every State of Nigeria of any transaction concerning land. It is an integral part of land transactions, as consent is usually required for the perfection of any land transaction. The main purpose of obtaining a Governor’s Consent is so the government is aware that ownership of land has been transferred to another person. This consent can be applied for and obtained multiple times, as many times as possession of such land is being handed over to multiple purchasers over time. Governor’s consent helps in the legalization of such property, as the government is made aware of the transfer of ownership rights. Therefore, as long as the consent is obtained by the buyer, the ownership rights will be properly secured.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Court Judgement</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This simply implies that the individual went into a court battle with the government to another party over an expanse of land and came out victorious. Such person can then proceed to process the appropriate land documentation to grant him exclusive rights to such land, which could be either C of O, Governor’s Consent, Excision or Gazette as the case may be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Probate &amp; Letter of Administration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Where a person who is owning any piece of land has died, the personal representatives of such person before exercising control or ownership over the property must obtain a Grant of Probate in case the deceased left a Will or Grant of Letter of Administration in case the deceased died intestate. The Probate and the Letter of Administration are the only valid titles to any property left behind by the deceased person. Both documents can be obtained via the Probate Registry of the State High Court or High Court of the Federal Capital Territory.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documents Required at the Stage of Acquiring a Land</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Purchase Receipt- This must clearly state the name(s) of the purchaser and must include their signature. The names of the buyers have to be boldly written for the documents and receipts to be valid.</li>
<li>Contract of sale: the contract of sale is the legal document that must give a full description of what is being purchased and a description of payments to be made in the present and the future.</li>
<li>Deed of Assignment- this is a legal document that explains that part of the property that is covered by the C of O stating that they have assigned that particular portion of land to the purchaser. This deed must be duly signed and stamped.</li>
<li>Survey Plan- Here, the land is mapped out accordingly to show the type of title such land already has. That is, if it is excised, gazetted, C of O, etc. it also shows if the land is still under government acquisition.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, it is sacrosanct for every intending purchaser of land or landed properties to ensure an investigation is conducted as to the title, accessibility, and usage of the land to be purchased. Apart from having a good title, a landed property may be encumbered for other reasons, which include existing mortgage or pledge of the property, criminal forfeiture among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DEED OF PARTITION</strong></p>
<p>A valid question that may arise from the legal implications of joint ownership is when the joint owners decide to severe their interest in the property? The answer is Positive. Joint owners may apply to the court to partition the property where there has been a persistent refusal by one or more joint owners to allow the other co-owners to enjoy their rights in the property or all joint owners can unanimously agree to partition the property.  A partition is an act that can be by an order of a court or otherwise by which property is divided into separate portions representing the proportional interest of owners in the property. The Purpose of partition is to eliminate the concurrent interest held by joint owners in the property, so in this case, each joint owner can enjoy and possess the property in severalty. Each divided property gets a new title and each sharer gives up his interest in the property in favour of other sharers.  The transferee can now deal with his share of the property in any manner, he may decide to sell, lease as the absolute owner.</p>
<p>In the case of <strong><em>YESUFU V. ADAMA (2002) LPELR-CA/L/400/97,</em></strong> it was held that what amounts to a valid partition of land is a matter of fact, which must be established by credible evidence; all joint owners of family land held under native law and custom must participate in the voluntary partition of the property. Any deed creating such partition, if not executed by all joint owners is not voidable, but void. It was also held that partition can be effected orally under the native law and custom, and it could be by deed.</p>
<p>Joint owners can secure the service of a lawyer to draft the deed of partition. Once that is done, it must be duly registered at the Lands Registry. Registration gives it validity and makes it tenable in the court of law.</p>
<p>It is very important for any person who wishes to purchase land or landed property to investigate the title of the vendor. If the vendor is a joint owner of such property, the purchaser must conduct due diligence and ensure that other joint owners have approved the sale.</p>
<p><strong>Contents of Deed of Partition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Introductory Part: </strong>This part contains the nature of the transaction, the name of parties, the date and the recital. The parties to the deed must be legal persons and their names and addresses must be included. The recital section provides a statement of facts that constitute the background of the current transaction. In the case of <strong><em>Nitel v. Rockonoh</em></strong> <strong><em>properties limited (1995)2NWLR part 378, page 437</em></strong>, it was held that a recital explains the reasons for the transaction. A recital can be introductory or narrative.</li>
<li><strong>The Operative Part: </strong>The testatum is the statement commencing the operating part, usually with words like “<em>Now this deed witnesseth”.</em> The Parcel clause gives a description of the property and the harbendum clause defines the extent of ownership to be enjoyed by the owners after the partition. The operative part also contains how the land will be divided among the owners and it also includes the proportion each owner will take.</li>
<li><strong>The Concluding Part: </strong>This part contains the testimonium, attestation and execution clause. Attestation means the witnessing of the execution of the deed, a testimonium shows all the parties executing the deed. The execution means signing of the deed by parties and witnesses to the partition.</li>
</ul>
<p>For illiterates, the illiterate jurat must be included in line with the illiterate Protection Act. The content of the document must be read and interpreted to him and when he appears perfectly to have understood it then he will affix his thumbprint. It must also be endorsed by the person who read it to the illiterate person.</p>
<p>The deed of the partition must also be endorsed or franked by the lawyer who prepares it. Rule 10 of the Rules of Professional Conduct 2007 provides that <strong><em>“A lawyer acting in his capacity as a legal practitioner shall not sign or file a legal document unless there is affixed on any such document a seal and a stamp approved by the Nigerian Bar Association</em></strong>”. His name, address, seal and stamp must be on the deed.</p>
<p>Lastly, a deed of partition ensures a legal division of property that is jointly held thus creating new owners. After partition, the deed must be perfected with the land registry to register the interest of new owners in the property.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renting an apartment in Lagos is one of the most tasking time-consuming experiences. Lekki is one of the high brow and expensive areas in Lagos State with prospective residential, commercial and agricultural locations.</p>
<p>Before renting an apartment in Lagos, it is important to conduct due diligence on the apartment to be rented, the landlord, the location, and all other factors, before making a decision on the apartment that suits the needs of the tenant and also to avoid being swindled as a result of the ignorance of the prospective tenant. This article aims to give a brief guide on the factors to be considered in renting an apartment in Lekki, Lagos.</p>
<p><strong>Factors to Consider in Renting an Apartment in Lekki</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Rent-</strong> the rent is the consideration paid by the tenant to the landlord for use of the residential apartment. The rent to be paid on an apartment plays a major role in the decision-making process of renting an apartment. Lekki is one of the populous areas of Lagos State occupied majorly by high-income earners; hence, it is not unusual for the rent to be expensive. Before renting an apartment, the prospective tenant must determine if he/she can reasonably afford the rent by considering one’s budget.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the rent, some apartments in Lekki usually include a service charge in addition to the rent, which includes charges for water, sewer, garbage, electricity, security, etc. It is important to find out the cost of utilities to provided and ensuring the provision for services or utilities is contained in the tenancy agreement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Apartment</strong>&#8211; it is important to conduct a due diligence investigation on the apartment to be rented and to check for any physical defects. This can be done by physically visiting the prospective apartment for inspection purposes and not relying majorly on the pictorial presentation of the apartment. Upon visitation, it is important to check the cosmetic appearance such as the roof, windows, building structure, etc, and also the availability of the necessary amenities such as electricity, water, security, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Landlord- </strong>another important guide is to determine who the landlord is. Often time prospective tenants come in contact with agents who procure the agreement for them. There have been issues of house hunters being swindled of their money because they transacted with unscrupulous persons posing as agents of the landlord. Bearing this in mind, it is important to have knowledge of the owner of the apartment and also to determine if the landlord is a person of good ethics and can guarantee the tenant quiet possession and enjoyment of the apartment.</li>
<li><strong>Duration of the Tenancy</strong>&#8211; another guide to renting an apartment in Lekki is to consider the duration of the tenancy, whether for the long term or short term that suits the needs of the tenant.</li>
<li><strong>Tenancy Agreement-</strong> this is a legal agreement whether written or oral executed between a landlord and a tenant regarding possession of premises (it is advisable to execute a written agreement). After deciding on the apartment to be rented and negotiation on the rent is concluded, a tenancy agreement which sets out the terms and agreement between parties is executed between the landlord and the tenant as proof of an existing contract between parties. The option for renewal of the tenancy agreement must be expressly stated in the agreement as well as the length of notice to be given before terminating the tenancy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before signing this agreement, it is advised to consult the services of a lawyer to scrutinize the agreement to ensure that all clauses contained in the agreement meet the needs of the tenant and to prevent any form of liability. The tenancy agreement usually contains important clauses such as;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Full names and addresses of the parties (landlord and tenant).</li>
<li>Full details of the demised property in Lekki.</li>
<li>Duration of the tenancy.</li>
<li>Consideration (rent) to be paid on the apartment and the method of payment.</li>
<li>Mode of terminating the agreement.</li>
<li>Rent review clause (where applicable).</li>
<li>Renewal clause.</li>
<li>Re-entry clause.</li>
<li>Undertakings (covenant) to be performed by the landlord.</li>
<li>Undertakings (covenant) to be performed by tenant.</li>
<li>Commencement date of the tenancy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Agency Fee &amp; Legal Fee:</strong> Apart from rent, the cost for renting an apartment in Lekki and most parts of Lagos often includes. Such fee is usually between 5% to 10%. Tenant must pay agency fee and legal fee separately. However, such fees are only payable in the first year of renting the apartment, the tenant will not pay such fees upon renewal of the rent in subsequent years.</li>
<li><strong>Receipt</strong>&#8211; another guide to renting an apartment is to ensure that the tenant collects the receipt of payment of the rent and other fees as proof of payment. The is receipt very important because most landlords do not provide a tenancy agreement immediately after the payment. The receipt is only evidence of the contract of a tenancy prior to signing the tenancy agreement. The receipt should contain the following-</li>
<li>The date on which the rent was received.</li>
<li>The full names of the landlord and tenant.</li>
<li>Location of the premises in respect of which the rent is paid.</li>
<li>Amount of the rent paid, and</li>
<li>Period to which the payment relates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, renting an apartment in Lekki can be a challenging experience, hence, it is important to be properly guided before making any form of payment to avoid being swindled or renting an apartment that will be detrimental to the tenant. The factors stipulated above are also applicable to renting apartments in other parts of Lagos and most parts of Nigeria.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contract of sale and deed of assignment are both documents used in real estate-related transactions in Nigeria. Although they are both used in property transactions the difference between both documents can be derived from their distinctive features and the role they each individually play in the acquisition of title to landed properties in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Generally, there are five stages involved in the process of acquisition of land in Nigeria, which range from the pre-contract stage to the post-completion stage. The contract of sale is executed at the second stage of a land transaction; it is evidenced in writing and is not mandated to be under seal. It is a preliminary land document executed in the transfer of ownership in the land to another from the seller to the buyer. A contract of sale takes effect after it has been exchanged between parties and it contains not only the basic requirements but goes further to include detailed terms, consideration, and future obligations of what the parties have agreed in respect of the land transaction. Some of the provisions of a contract of sale are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full details of the parties &#8211; (name and address).</li>
<li>Particulars of the property to be transacted (location, survey plan, etc).</li>
<li>Particulars of witnesses.</li>
<li>Purchase price of the property.</li>
<li>Payment of deposit, to whom it is to be paid, and in what capacity.</li>
<li>Balance and interest on unpaid purchase sum where the payment is to be paid in installments.</li>
<li>The capacity of the vendor.</li>
<li>Risk and insurance.</li>
<li>Possession before completion</li>
<li>Completion date of the transaction.</li>
<li>Provision for fixtures and fittings.</li>
<li>Specific terms, risks, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where a contract of sale has been executed between parties, an equitable right of the title is passed to the buyer as the vendor still retains legal title to the land and holds the same in trust for the buyer. A vendor cannot transact with the land contrary to the agreement in the contract and no party can rescind the contract without being held liable for a breach of contract.</p>
<p><strong><b>Features of a Contract of Sale</b></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In a contract of sale, the vendor is committed to the transaction and the purchaser has sufficient time to investigate the title before the final completion of the transaction.</li>
<li>The death of either party to the transaction does not terminate the contract as personal representatives can proceed with the contract of sale.</li>
<li>A contract of sale prevents last-minute withdrawal as withdrawal would amount to a breach of the contract.</li>
<li>A contract of sale protects the equitable interest of the purchaser</li>
<li>It crystallizes the position of the parties as terms have been expressly agreed upon.</li>
<li>The vendor cannot unilaterally and subsequently increase the purchase price as the price has already been fixed in the contract.</li>
<li>Payment of lesser stamp duties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deed of Assignment is the legal instrument executed between a buyer and seller upon the negotiation and completion phase of a sale of land transaction, subject to perfection. It is usually demanded by the buyer of the real property at the conclusion of the property transaction as the final legal document that transfers the interest of title in a land without any conditions attached, beyond the payment of the consideration price of the property. In a deed of assignment, the nomenclature of parties changes from Vendor to Assignor and Buyer to Assignee. Upon the execution of a deed of assignment between parties, there is a permanent transfer of legal title and ownership to land from the assignor to the assignee for a consideration paid and accepted by the assignor.</p>
<p>Deed of assignment is required to be evidenced in writing; to be signed, sealed, and delivered by parties to the transaction. A deed of assignment is said to have been delivered when interest has passed to the Assignee and the interest can be passed with or without a physical handover.</p>
<p>Another major difference between a contract of sale and deed is that under a deed of assignment, the title of land acquired is required to be perfected upon payment of the full consideration and execution of the deed. The perfection of title involves the assignee taken the required steps to register the deed of assignment at the appropriate Land Registry. The process for the perfection of a deed of assignment involves the following three steps;</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining Governors Consent.</li>
<li>Stamping of the deed of assignment, and</li>
<li>Registration of the deed of assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in a contract of sale, the buyer only acquires equitable interest in the property while the seller retains the legal interest in trust for the buyer. In the deed of assignment, the assignee acquires legal interest in the property and it can serve as a good root of title to subsequent buyers while the interest of the assignor on the same property is completely extinguished.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A deed of assignment is the legal instrument prepared and drafted by a lawyer of an assignor (seller) or assignee (buyer) upon the negotiation and completion of a sale of the land transaction. It is used to transfer legal title and ownership to land from the assignor to the assignee for a consideration paid and accepted by the assignor.</p>
<p>Deed of assignment is evidenced in writing to be signed, sealed, and delivered by parties to the transaction. A deed of assignment is said to have been delivered when interest has passed and the interest can be passed with or without a physical handover.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements to Prepare a Deed of Assignment In Lagos</strong></p>
<p>There are important information to be requested from parties when preparing a deed of assignment in Lagos, as they would form the particulars contained in a valid deed of assignment that can be enforced by the court.  The same requirements are applicable in other parts of the country. These particulars are as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>Full details of parties to the transaction (names, address, status). the parties must be persons at law, i.e. individuals or corporate entities.</li>
<li>Nature of assignor&#8217;s (vendors) title.</li>
<li>The full description/particulars of the property with fittings &amp; fixtures where applicable.</li>
<li>History of the property being transferred from the first time it was acquired to the current time of sale, including documents it previously had to date.</li>
<li>Details of the document that the property possesses.</li>
<li>The consideration paid in respect of the property transaction (purchase price) and the willingness of the assignor to accept the price paid for the property.</li>
<li>The nature of the transaction and the capacity of the assignor (vendor).</li>
<li>Covenants both parties to the transaction undertake to fulfill to perfect the transfer of the title.</li>
<li>Signature of the parties and that of the witnesses to the transaction and where either party to the transaction is a company, the common seal of the company will be affixed to the deed and will be signed by two directors or one director and a secretary of the company.</li>
<li>Survey plan, local authority, and town planning authority of the area.</li>
<li>Name and address of the Legal practitioner who prepared the deed.</li>
<li>Illiterate jurat which is to be attested before a Magistrate or Notary Public (this is particularly necessary where either party to the transaction is illiterate).</li>
<li>Section for the Governor’s consent to be signed by Governor or designated representative of the Governor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the above information has been had and obtained, the deed of assignment is subsequently prepared by the solicitor acting on behalf of the assignee or acting on behalf of both parties to the transaction and copies will be delivered to each party.</p>
<p>Upon payment of the full consideration and due execution of the deed, the assignee is to take steps to register the deed of assignment for the perfection of title at the Land Registry, where the following process will be followed;</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining Governors Consent upon application and payment of prescribed fees, such as charting fee, application fee, administrative charges, and endorsement fee, etc.</li>
<li>Stamping of the deed of assignment by the Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (SIRS) where the parties to the transaction are individuals or the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) where either party to the transaction is a company.</li>
<li>Registration of the deed of assignment by presenting the deed of assignment to the Lagos State Lands Registry within 60 days of execution of the deed, for registration which subsequently signifies the completion of the registration process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>A deed of assignment which is also called a deed of conveyance in some jurisdictions is a legal document that transfers ownership and interest in land from an assignor to the assignee. It is prepared by a lawyer representing the buyer or representing both parties to the transaction.</p>
<p>A deed of assignment after due execution should be registered with the state government where the land is registered. A registered deed of assignment transfers a legal interest in the property and serves as a good root of title that signifies the transfer of title from one person to another.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Deed of Assent is a document or instrument of the Executor or legal Administrator of an estate to transfer, pass over or vest a legal interest or title in a property of a deceased person to the named beneficiary in a Will or any other third party. It grants the beneficiary legal ownership over a gift that has been given by a Will. The <strong>Administration of Estate Laws </strong>of each State of the Federation govern and regulate the estates of a deceased person.</p>
<p>It is important to state that a will in itself cannot confer title or ownership on a beneficiary, it is just a legal document that expresses how the assets of a testator will be shared upon death. A deed of assent serves the purpose of conferring legal ownership of a gift in a will on the named beneficiaries or a third party by Executors or Administrators of an estate. Where a deed of assent has been duly executed in favour of the beneficiaries, a third party cannot subsequently lay claims to the properties that have been duly passed on to the intended beneficiaries.</p>
<p><strong>Effect of an Assent in Lagos State</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 40</strong> of the Administration of Estate Law of Lagos State provides for the effect of assent by the personal representative. It states that <strong><em>“a personal representative may assent to the vesting in any person who either by devise, bequest, devolution, appropriation or otherwise, may be entitled to, either beneficiary or as a trustee or personal representative, of any estate or interest in real estate to which the testator or interstate was entitled or over which he exercised a general power of appointment by his will and which devolved upon the personal representative”.</em></strong></p>
<p>From the above-cited section, it can be adduced that a beneficiary cannot lay claim to the share of an estate of a deceased until the Executors or Administrators give their assent in writing to the vesting of the property.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions of a valid Assent</strong></p>
<p>A deed of assent to the vesting of a legal estate must meet the following conditions before it can be valid. These conditions as provided in <strong>Section 40 (4)</strong> of the Administration of Estate Laws of Lagos State are as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>The assent must be in writing;</li>
<li>It must be duly signed by all personal representatives or executors;</li>
<li>The property in relation to which the assent is granted must be .certain and;</li>
<li>The beneficiary in whose favour it is given must be stated.</li>
</ul>
<p>An assent not in writing or not in favour of a named person shall not be effectual to pass a legal estate.</p>
<p><strong>Application for the Registration of a Deed of Assent</strong></p>
<p>Ordinarily, a deed of assent is not a registrable instrument because stamp duty is not paid on it, however, where the subject property vested to a beneficiary in a will concerns real property, it is to be registered at the appropriate land registry where the property is located to inform the state and the public that the ownership in the property has changed.</p>
<p>The Directorate of Land Registry, Lands Bureau of Lagos State, has provided a checklist of the requirement for its registration.  These requirements are as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>An application letter addressed to the Registrar of Titles requesting to register a deed of assent with a functional phone number and email address.</li>
<li>Two copies of the deed of assent, which must be dated, signed and each page initialled.</li>
<li>Passport photographs of all the administrator/executors to be attached to the deed.</li>
<li>The front cover of the deed must be signed and sealed by the solicitor who prepared the deed.</li>
<li>Spiral/bookbinding.</li>
<li>A certified true copy of the root of the title.</li>
<li>A certified true copy of the letter of administration/ Will.</li>
<li>A sworn affidavit deposed to by the administrators/executors attesting to the vesting.</li>
<li>Original for sighting and one copy of the valid means of identification of all the administrators/executors.</li>
<li>Payment receipts<strong><u>.</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>A Deed of Assent is so important in the devolution of the estate of the deceased. The title in a property cannot pass to the intended named beneficiary or any third party without a duly executed deed of assent, which must be signed by the Executors or Administrators to the Will. And as earlier stated, once it has fulfilled the conditions highlighted above, a third party cannot lay claims to the properties of the deceased already passed on to the beneficiaries.</p>
<p>It is important to state that an assent need not be by deed and if it is by a deed, it is not a registrable instrument as the stamp duty payment is not required on it. This is because an estate duty has already been paid before a grant of probate or letter of administration was issued to the executors or the administrators.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The enactment of the Land Use Act 1978 (the Act) birthed a new system wherein by virtue of Section 1 of same, all lands within the territory of a State are vested in the Governor of that State who shall hold same in trust for the benefit of the people. Thus, a person in Nigeria cannot “own” land but rather is conferred the right to occupy the same for a certain time. This article will assess the means by which the right of occupancy is evidenced, the obligations and rights conferred on the holder as well as judicial decisions on the status of the Certificate of Occupancy.</p>
<p>Giving credence to the fact that the Governor only holds the lands within a State’s territory for the benefit of the people, Section 9 of the Act provides that a Certificate which shall be termed “Certificate of Occupancy” can be issued upon payment to any person under the hand of the Governor as evidence of the right of occupancy over the said land.</p>
<p>The holder of a certificate of occupancy is deemed to have accepted the terms and conditions attached to it, which are enforceable against himself and his successors in title. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Payment of penal rent for breaching any covenant or condition such as failing to effect improvements on the land or alienating the land or any part thereof without the consent of the Governor. (s. 5(1e and f))</li>
<li>Payment to the Governor for any unexhausted improvements of the land existing on the land at the date of entering the occupation. (s. 10(a).</li>
<li>Payment of rent as prescribed under the Act from time to time. (s. 10(b))</li>
<li>Allowing the Governor or his agent access to the land for purposes of inspection during the daytime. (s. 11)</li>
<li>To maintain in good and substantial repairs all beacons or other landmarks defining the boundary granted under the Certificate of Occupancy and in default shall be liable to bear the expenses of doing same. (s. 13)</li>
<li>The land covered by the Certificate of Occupancy cannot be alienated without the prior consent of the Governor, otherwise, such alienation shall have no effect. (s. 22).</li>
</ol>
<p>The rights conferred on a holder of a statutory right of occupancy include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive rights to the land, which is enforceable against all persons except the Governor of the State where the land is situated. (s. 14)</li>
<li>Sole right to absolute possession of all improvements on the land. (s. 15a).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Right to transfer, assign and mortgage any improvement on the land subject to the provisions of the Act. (s. 15b)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Right to be compensated in the event the land is acquired by the Governor for public purposes. (s. 29(1))</li>
</ul>
<p>The issuance of this certificate confers on the holder a Statutory Right of Occupancy. This Right could either be express or deemed grant. It is express where the certificate is issued under the hand of the Governor to a named person. However, to cater for lands owned by people before the commencement of the Act, Section 34 states that such persons upon the commencement of the Act are deemed to have been granted a Right of Occupancy over said land.</p>
<p>With regards to the status of a Certificate of Occupancy, it has been held by the Supreme Court in a number of cases such as <em>Ogunleye v. Oni (1990) 2 NWLR (Pt. 135) 745;</em> <strong><em>Otukpo v. John &amp; Anor (2012) LPELR-25053(SC</em></strong>); <strong><em>Madu v. Madu (2008) LPELR-22732(SC) </em></strong>that it only serves as prima facie evidence of title or possession to land but not conclusive proof of same. Therefore, a holder of a certificate of occupancy is presumed to have an exclusive right of occupancy over the land to which it relates until proven otherwise.</p>
<p>A person who can establish with evidence a better title over the land can render void the right of occupancy conferred on the holder of A Certificate of Occupancy. Thus, in the case of Ogunleye v. Oni where the plaintiff had a certificate of occupancy granted in 1983 and the defendant proved ownership over the same land before the commencement of the Act, the Defendant was held to have a better title and by the application of Section 34 had a deemed grant of a statutory right of occupancy.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the Certificate of Occupancy is recognized as a means of evidencing the right of occupancy over land, it merely raises a presumption that is rebuttable.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a Certificate of Occupancy in recent times is a useful piece of document, while it is not conclusive proof of the right of occupancy over land, it is one that is recognized by the law unless a better title is proved, which is unlikely in most cases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO BUY LAND &amp; HOUSE IN LEKKI LAGOS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BUYING LAND IN IBEJU LEKKI</strong></p>
<p>Overtime, Lekki has become a respectable commercial hub, a residential zone, and a go-to tourist spot, thereby making Lekki a rave in the real estate industry. Lekki is one of the areas in Lagos State with various vacant lands for development. Also, there are tens of thousands of properties developed or under development in Lekki that are currently being marketed to prospective buyers.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that most of the lands in Lekki are acquired by the Government usually released by way of excision which is thereafter gazetted.</p>
<p>To buy a house or land in Lekki, it is essential that due diligence and proper check are conducted. After the proposed property has been duly verified, appropriate documents must be prepared to evidence agreement between parties and transfer title.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO INVESTIGATE BEFORE BUYING A LAND IN LEKKI</strong></p>
<p>Generally, it is advised that before contracting to purchase a property that a buyer shows great care, attention and diligence. The guidance of a property lawyer should be sought to conduct a property search before proceeding with any purchase of land or house in Lekki due to the huge risk involved in such a transaction. Below are places where investigation of property title can be conducted before purchase.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Lands Registry</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There is no state in Nigeria without a land registry, which is often under the Ministry of Land.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Surveyor General Office</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is essential to conduct a charting of landed property at the Surveyor General Office, especially where such a property is not yet registered. Charting of a property is very crucial in Lekki because so many lands in this area are under one form of government acquisition or land. Charting at the Surveyor General office will reveal whether a property proposed to be purchased has been acquired by the government for any purpose.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Corporate Affairs Commission</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The C.A.C keeps a record of all charges on limited liability company in Nigeria. Investigating in the commission will help disclose whether there are any registered charges on the property of a company. The search at CAC is only relevant where the owner of the property to be purchased is a corporate entity.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Physical Inspection</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Conducting a physical inspection on the proposed property to be purchased before such a purchase is very important. A physical inspection will reveal things that cannot be found in the search of any government archives. A physical may reveal whether the proposed seller of the land has a possessory right on the property himself. It may also reveal defects such as proximity to a proposed road or even ocean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACT OF SALE OF LAND </strong></p>
<p>Contract of sale of land is an important aspect of property law in Nigeria because the interest in a property is transferred from one party to another. The contract stipulates the terms and conditions needed for the sale and purchase of a property. This document protects parties in a contract and where there is any occurrence of non-performance by any party, such party will be liable for a breach of contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>STAGES INVOLVED IN SALE OF PROPERTY</strong></p>
<p>There are various stages involved in buying a property in Lekki Lagos, these stages will be summarized below.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Pre-Contract Stage:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is expedient that before buying a property in Lekki, a preliminary meeting with the property owner is done. This will allow one to delve into the nature of title on the land, easements, fixtures, restrictive covenants, nature of the transaction, reversionary interests, etc. Occasionally, there are properties available in Lekki for purchase even before they have been constructed. These properties are known as Off-Plan Properties. Buying off-plan can be extremely risky and at the same time highly profitable. The success of buying such properties depends on the measures taken by the buyer. This stage is just to elicit special knowledge of properties which will help reveal any encumbrances. Also, the parties can negotiate and deliberate on the price, mode of payment, whether payments would be made outrightly or in installments.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Contract Stage: </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the stage where the parties execute the contract of sale agreement. Here, the parties have agreed to transfer interest in the property but are yet to be satisfied. For this stage to be valid there must be offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relation, etc.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Post Contract Stage:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Here, the buyer is expected to make a thorough investigation of the root of the title. This is the basis for the completion stage. Then, a deed of transfer is prepared by the buyer’s solicitor with copies sent to the vendor’s solicitor.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Completion Stage:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As the name implies, it is where both the vendor and seller perfect their transaction, subject to payment of full purchase price and delivery of the property to the buyer with the original title and documents of the property purchased.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> The Post- Completion Stage- Perfection of Title: </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is well known that a land transaction is yet to be finalized and legal until the consent of the Governor of the state has been gotten in respect of the transaction. All that vest a legal title on the buyer is the Governor’s consent, Stamping and Registration of document. Hence, it is advised that a buyer obtains the application for the Governor’s consent through the State’s Ministry of Lands. Thereafter, the payment of stamp duties on the approved deed of transfer is made. Stamp duties must be paid within 30 days of the execution of the deed of transfer. The final stage of this perfection is the registration of the deed of assignment. The three stages of perfection of the title are to be done simultaneously.</p>
<p>Finally, buying land or house in Lekki can serve as a good investment option or opportunity to secure a befitting accommodation, however, it is important that every prospective buyer conducts due diligence by engaging an expert, most especially <a href="https://www.resolutionlawng.com/lawyers/">property lawyers</a> who can verify and ensure seamless transfer of title before jumping into any property purchase. This is very critical for three main reasons: first, to detect and avoid buying property under any form of acquisition; to facilitate a seamless transfer of property title; lastly to avoid some deliberate property fraudsters who often try to reap off unwary buyers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO BUY LAND IN LAGOS AND PAY &#8220;INSTALMENTALLY&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>To buy land in Lagos and pay instalmentally, the buyer must ensure that the seller has the legal right to transfer ownership in that property. Such a property transaction goes beyond merely inspecting the property or confirming the seller has a legal title on such a property.</p>
<p>It is pertinent for any purchaser who intends to buy a land or house on installments to execute a formal contract of sale because of its numerous advantages over an open or oral contract.</p>
<p>A contract for sale of land is an agreement between a purchaser and a land vendor where parties agree to the sale of land, stating the considerations, obligations, and other terms for the transfer of land ownership from the vendor to the purchaser.  A contract for sale of land can contain a mutual agreement between parties that the buyer can pay the purchase price through a series of installments, either directly or through a financing agency or bank. In a land purchase agreement based on installments, the buyer usually takes immediate possession of the house as the equitable interest passes to him, while the seller retains legal title as security until the buyer pays the full purchase price. It is only upon satisfaction of the contractual agreement that the seller will then proceed to transfer the legal interest and ownership of the land to the purchaser by issuing him a deed of assignment or a deed of transfer. However, the parties may also agree the seller will remain in possession until the satisfaction of the entire contract.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of a contract of sale of land when buying a property in installments   </strong></p>
<p>A contract of sale is very important, especially when buying land or a house on installments because of the benefits that shall be discussed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The certainty of terms,</li>
<li>The binding nature of the contract,</li>
<li>The time is given to the purchaser to investigate vendors title,</li>
<li>It can be used to circumvent implied covenants by making express provisions,</li>
<li>The death of either party will not terminate the contract as their personal representatives will proceed with the contract,</li>
<li>It prevents unnecessary last-minute withdrawal as parties are bound by the terms and as such withdrawal will amount to a breach of contract,</li>
<li>It also prevents gazumping (the vendor cannot just wake up and increase the purchase price as the price has already been fixed in the contract) and gazundering (the purchaser, on the other hand, cannot compel the vendor to reduce the price because he has seen another offer with a lower price),</li>
<li>The vendor can tender it as evidence of the expectation of money.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, although when buying land on installment, it may serve as a flexible alternative to a mortgage loan, however, parties to a contract of sale of land should seek professional advice and assistance from their respective solicitors to structure a contract that will adequately protect the interest of the buyer as well as the seller.</p>
