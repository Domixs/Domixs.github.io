										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>10 KEY FACTS &amp; BENEFITS YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT TRADEMARK REGISTRATION IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The government agency in charge of trademark registration in Nigeria is the Trademarks, Patents and Designs Registry, Commercial Law Department of the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The trademark registration can be done through the accredited agents of the registry. Most law firms who engaged in intellectual property services such as <a href="http://www.resolutionlawng.com/">Resolution Law Firm</a> are accredited agents of the Trademarks Registry.</li>
<li>Failure to register a trademark for your goods and services may give room to other persons to exploit your goods and services, register a similar trademark ahead of you and restrict you not only from using the trademark but also from selling your goods and services.</li>
<li>Trademark registration is a mandatory requirement to register your product with the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (<strong>NAFDAC</strong>) and obtain a NAFDAC registration number.</li>
<li>There are 6(six) major steps involved in trademark registration in Nigeria. These steps are:
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Searching a proposed mark to be registered at the appropriate trademark class</li>
<li>Filing of trademark application</li>
<li>Examination of trademark application by the trademark examiner</li>
<li>Issuance of acceptance letter</li>
<li>Publication of trademark in trademark journal</li>
<li>Collection of the trademark certificate</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Foreign companies, local companies as well as any individual in any part of the world are eligible to file for the registration of a trademark with the trademark registry. The trademark item can be words, marks, numbers, name, device, signature, logo etc or a combination of any of these items.</li>
<li>For a trademark to be registrable, it must meet up with any of the followings requirements:
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>It must be distinctive (unique)</li>
<li>It must not resemble the flag, coat of arms, or emblem of any country without appropriate authorization</li>
<li>It must not be contrary to public morality, deceptive or scandalous</li>
<li>It must not conflict with any existing trademark registered in that class or category</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>Where there is any infringement on a registered trademark, i.e. where another person other than the owner of the registered trademark markets his or her products or services using the registered trademark, both civil and criminal action can be commenced against such infringer. A civil suit can be commenced at the Federal High Court according to the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 2004. Also, the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, Etc) Act, 2015 criminalizes the use of a trademark on the internet or any other computer network without the consent and authority of the owner or interfering with the right of the owner in respect of a trademark. Upon conviction, such an offender is liable to imprisonment or fine or both.</li>
<li>Trademark is considered intellectual property and as such, it can be licensed or franchised by the owner of the registered trademark to other persons or corporate bodies. It can also be transferred, assigned or sold like any real property.</li>
<li>There are 45 classes of trademarks for products and services. This is known as the Nice classification and is open to states who are parties to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. This classification is used both nationally and internationally. Trademark applicants are at liberty to choose which category best suits their goods and services.</li>
<li>Trademark is territorial, this means that an applicant must register their trademark in all the countries where they seek protection for their products and services. However, there are regional organizations like the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), the African Regional Intellectual Property Organisation, etc which affords trademark protection to applicant’s products and services in all the member states within their Organisation. Nigeria currently does not belong to any regional organization, so the only way to register a trademark in Nigeria is through the Trademarks registry based in Abuja.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ESSENCE OF TRADEMARK REGISTRATION IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>The trademark registration in Nigeria has various importance. A trademark is a recognizable word or words, phrase, logo, symbol, signs or expressions registered at the Trademark Registry to represent or identify a company, products, or services to distinguish its brand from others in the commercial market, hence, it is of grave importance to register a trademark timeously to prevent a third party from infringing on the mark.</p>
<p><strong>Section 9</strong> of the Trade Marks Act, which governs trademark in Nigeria makes the provision of what can be accepted for registration as a trademark, and these include;</p>
<ul>
<li>A name of a company, individual, or firm represented in a particular or special manner</li>
<li>The signature of the applicant for registration</li>
<li>An invented word or words</li>
<li>A word or words having no direct reference to the character or quality of goods not being in its ordinary specification a geographical name or surname</li>
<li>Any other distinctive mark.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Advantage of Trademark Registration in Nigeria</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The exclusivity of right</strong>&#8211; A trademark when registered in respect of particular goods or service grants the exclusive right to use of the mark in respect to that goods or services to distinguish one’s brand from that of other brands in the commercial market, and the exclusive right shall be deemed infringed by a third party not being the proprietor using it without the permission of the owner or uses a mark so resembling as is likely to deceive or cause confusion in the minds of the general public.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exclusive right enjoyed by the proprietor of a trademark is guaranteed under the provision of <strong>Section 5</strong> of the Act which provides that <strong><em>&#8220;Subject to the provisions of this section, the registration (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) of a person in Part A of the register as proprietor of a trademark (other than a certification trade mark) in respect of any goods shall if valid, give or be deemed to have given to that person the exclusive right to the use of that trademark in relation to those goods&#8221;.</em></strong></p>
<p>The above section of the law also goes further to state what constitutes an infringement of a trademark registered and provides that <strong><em>“Without prejudice to the generality of the right to the use of a trademark given by such registration as aforesaid, that right shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who, not being the proprietor of the trademark or a registered user thereof using it by way of the permitted use, uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion, in the course of trade, in relation to any goods in respect of which it is registered, and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken either &#8211;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>a) as being used as a trademark; or</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>b) in a case in which the trademark is used upon the goods or in physical relation thereto or in an advertising circular or other advertisement issued to the public, as importing a reference to some person having the right either as proprietor or as a registered user to use the trade mark or to goods with which such a person as aforesaid is connected in the course of trade.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protection against Infringement of Intellectual Property</strong>&#8211; the essence of trademark and the Trademark Act is to protect the intellectual property of individuals, business owners, and corporate bodies. Registration of the trademark serves as a pre-requisite requirement for the institution of infringement action under the Trademark Act where it has been illegally infringed upon by a third party. In relation to where the mark registered to give distinctiveness to other product or services in the commercial market and it is illegally infringed on without the consent of the owner, Section 3 of the Trademark Act 1967 provides that <strong><em>“no person shall be entitled to institute any proceedings to prevent or recover damages for an infringement of an unregistered trademark”</em></strong>. Considering the impact of section 3 of the Act cited, it can be inferred that for a proprietor to exercise a right over a trademark, and commence legal proceedings for an infringement action, it must be duly registered in respect of particular goods or services.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The uniqueness of Product</strong>&#8211; the essence of a trademark is to distinguish one&#8217;s unique marketing tool from another. The registration can be for a business logo, recognized symbol, color pattern, name, and others to make it easily recognizable and relatable to a brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assignment and Transfer of Trademark-</strong> upon the registration of a trademark one has exclusive rights over it. Another importance of the trademark registered is that like any other valuable asset one has, the ownership of the trademark can be assigned and transferred to another individual, business owner, or corporate entity to generate additional revenue, especially where the trademark is widely popular and has gained the goodwill of the public. The assignment of the trademark can be in respect of the business in total or the particular goods and services covered by that trademark as provided under <strong>Section 26</strong> of the Act.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of registering a trademark is to ensure that no trademark is used that might likely deceive or cause confusion or even mislead members of the general public as to the distinctiveness between two separate trading entities. Registering a trademark also protects a business brand&#8217;s identity in the commercial marketplace. A trademark is infringed where another company&#8217;s brand elements are similar enough to confuse consumers.</p>
<p>The importance and essence of a trademark in Nigeria cannot be overemphasized, as it sets one&#8217;s product and services apart from others and it also guarantees and secures the product from any infringing action. Therefore, it is advisable to go the extra mile of registering one&#8217;s unique products and services with the Trademarks Registry after incorporating a company with the Corporate Affairs Commission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NIGERIA NOTAP REGISTRATION </strong></p>
<p>The National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP) is a government agency with the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology charged with the responsibility of implementing the acquisition, development, and transfer of foreign technology into Nigeria. It is governed by the <strong>National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion Act CAP N62 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN) 2004.</strong>  One of the activities of NOTAP is the registration of all Nigerian technology transfer agreements and contracts entered into for the transfer of technology to Nigerian parties. It is important to note that NOTAP requires registration of technology transfer agreements in sectors such as finance and insurance, manufacturing, franchising, technical services, management services, technical know-how, oil and gas, civil construction and power and energy, etc.  The procedure for the registration of a technology transfer agreement with NOTAP will be briefly explained in below.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure for NOTAP Registration</strong></p>
<p>Application for the registration of technology transfer agreement with NOTAP is made in the applicant&#8217;s company letterhead paper directed to the Director of NOTAP within thirty (30) days from the effective date of the agreement. <strong>Section 5</strong> of the NOTAP Act provides that <strong><em>&#8220;every contract or agreement which on the date of the coming into force of this Act had been entered into by any person in Nigeria and which still has an effect on the commencement of this Act in relation to any matter shall be registered with the National Office in the prescribed manner not later than six months after the commencement of this Act&#8221;.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 5(3)</strong> goes further to state that every application for the registration of a contract or agreement shall be addressed to the director and shall be accompanied by a number of certified true copies of the contract and agreement and by all other related documents annexed thereto.</p>
<p>Applicants are required to make payment of a presentation fee of <strong>N50, 000 (Fifty Thousand Naira)</strong> through the NOTAP online portal to commence registration, accompanied with the following information and documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy of the duly completed application form.</li>
<li>Certificate of Incorporation with the Corporate Affairs Commission.</li>
<li>Memorandum and Article of Association of the company.</li>
<li>A duly completed TAA Pre-Qualification Form.</li>
<li>Tax Payer Identification Number (TIN).</li>
<li>A draft copy of the Technology Transfer Agreement to be registered.</li>
<li>A copy of the duly completed NOTAP questionnaires for different sectors.</li>
<li>A duly completed copy of the Monitoring Form.</li>
<li>A copy of the feasibility study report of the company.</li>
<li>Annual audited accounts for the preceding three years.</li>
<li>Evidence of tax payment for the preceding three years.</li>
<li>Profile of the technical partner.</li>
<li>Performance bond for advanced payment.</li>
<li>A comprehensive training programme which must include the number of personnel, skill or knowledge to be acquired.</li>
<li>Approval or licenses obtained from the relevant authorities and bodies such as the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) for agreements on communication etc, where applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon the submission and evaluation of the technology transfer agreement, all issues, observations will be addressed by the agency before the approval of the registration through an official letter to the applicant. NOTAP evaluates the agreement in terms of its legal, economic, and technical benefits to the Nigerian economy before registration.</p>
<p>The registration with NOTAP can be granted upon conditions in some cases, where it is satisfied that it would be in the national best interest to grant same, although the agreement can still be subject to modifications adjustments, and submission of other documents such as tax clearance certificate, invoices, etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the registration can be successfully granted without conditions in writing by NOTAP, where it is certain that the scope of services contained in the technology transfer agreement is fair to both parties involved and there is value for money. In another sense, the application for registration can be rejected by NOTAP where it is observed that the technological interest of Nigeria is not considered in the negotiation, drafting, and implementation of the technology transfer agreement. It can also be rejected where the agreement contravenes the laws of Nigeria.</p>
<p>Finally, a Certificate of Registration is issued and granted to the applicant with the original copy of the agreement, which has been certified by Director- General of NOTAP.</p>
<p><strong>Fees Payable for the Registration with NOTAP</strong></p>
<p>The following official fees must be made through the NOTAP online Remita platform, as the printout page containing the Remita Retrieval Reference (RRR) will be submitted to NOTAP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation fee- N50, 000 (Fifty Thousand Naira).</li>
<li>The penalty fee for contracts not submitted for registration within 30 days of the effective date – N100, 000 (One Hundred Thousand Naira).</li>
<li>For contracts involving payments, the fees payable ranges from N150,000 (One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira) to N20,000,000 (Twenty Million Naira), depending on the payment involved in the contract.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional requirements for registration</strong></p>
<p>There are also general rules and guidelines provided by NOTAP for companies to adhere to before registration. Some of these requirements are as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>Where a technology transfer agreement is to be drawn up, the rules require that the technology transfer agreement should provide that the recipient enterprises in Nigeria acquire the explicit rights for the use of exploitation of the technology in question, and the term of the contract should be explicitly stated in the contract.</li>
<li>Where a Nigerian company is acquiring the rights to use a process, the full description of the rights granted should be stated in the technology transfer agreement.</li>
<li>All technology transfer agreements should make provisions for the deduction of appropriate local taxes.</li>
<li>All Nigerian government projects must be governed by the Nigerian Laws of Arbitration and the seat of arbitration should be in Nigeria.</li>
<li>There must be evidence of registration of intellectual property such as trademark, technical know-how, and patent, etc.</li>
<li>Details of expatriates including entry visas and other immigration documents should be submitted along with the non-availability of skills in Nigeria.</li>
<li>The technology content of the agreements should state the methods for the domestication f technology, local raw materials development, skills acquisition, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>These requirements are some of the rules that govern the requirements that technology transfer agreement must meet before registration with NOTAP, note that these highlighted requirements are a few of the requirements provided by NOTAP. Hence, applicants must conduct due diligence to be abreast with the rules to ensure that it meets the requirements before applying for registration.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>All individuals and companies interested in technology transfer agreements are eligible to apply for the registration with NOTAP. For the registration with NOTAP, any applications that fail to comply with the above requirements and procedure will be returned unprocessed to the applicant until the requirements are met. <strong>Section 6 (2) </strong>of the NOTAP Act provides that the Director shall not register any contract or agreement where he is satisfied that its purpose is for the transfer of technology freely available in Nigeria and where the price or other valuable consideration is not commensurate with the technology acquired or to be acquired.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>FORMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN NIGERIA</strong></h3>
<p>The enforcement of intellectual property rights in Nigeria involves various judicial and administrative mechanisms. The intellectual property right is an intangible property right, which is protected under the law.</p>
<p>The intellectual property connotes all forms of copyrights; Inventions in all fields of human endeavour; Industrial designs; and Trademarks, which include service marks and brand names.</p>
<p>The enforcement of intellectual property rights in Nigeria includes various measures by which intellectual property rights are protected under the law.</p>
<p>Essentially, there are four main types or forms of intellectual property common in Nigeria- they are trademarks, copyrights, patents and industrial designs.</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights are those mechanisms that allow owners, creators or holders of patents, trademarks or copyrighted works to benefit from their work and take necessary action in case of infringements.</p>
<p>The laws governing or regulating the enforcement of intellectual property rights and protections in Nigeria are codified in various statutes.</p>
<h3><strong>LAWS REGULATING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Trademarks Act</li>
<li>The Patents and Designs Act</li>
<li>The Merchandise Marks Act</li>
<li>The Copyright Act</li>
<li>The Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules</li>
<li>The Cybercrimes(Prohibition, Prevention, E.T.C.) Act of 2015</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>TYPES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENTS</strong></h3>
<p><strong>COPYRIGHT</strong>: The Copyright law provides that infringement copyright occurred if anybody who without the authorization of the owner of the copyright does any act, which is controlled by copyright.</p>
<p><strong>PATENT &amp; INDUSTRIAL DESIGN:</strong> where a person other than the patentee or owner of an industrial design or his assignees or person authorized by the owner does or causes any act to be done with regards to the use of a registered patent or industrial design, such an act shall constitute an infringement of such patent or industrial design.</p>
<p>T<strong>RADEMARK</strong>: under the law, a registered trademark would be deemed to have been infringed if any person not being the owner or person authorized by the owner, uses a mark identical with or nearly resembling a registered trademark that it can likely mislead or causes confusion in the market place in relation to goods or services the said trademark represents.</p>
<h3><strong>JURISDICTION OF COURT TO ENFORCE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</strong></h3>
<p>Generally, the jurisdiction to hear <a href="https://lawcarenigeria.com/overview-of-intellectual-property-in-nigeria/">intellectual property law</a> cases is given under section <em>251 (1)(f) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended 2011)</em>, exclusively to the Federal High Court.</p>
<p>It provides thus;</p>
<p><em>“<strong>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Constitution . . . the Federal High Court shall have and exercise exclusive jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other court in civil causes and matter:”</strong> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>“Any Federal enactment relating to copyright, patent, designs, trademarks and passing-off, industrial designs and merchandise marks, business names, commercial and industrial monopolies, combines and trusts, standards of goods and commodities and industrial standards”</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p>This provision is in the same manner, similar to the provisions of <em>section 7 of the Federal High Court Act. </em></p>
<p>It can be stated that all intellectual property laws specifically confers jurisdiction on its subject matter only on the Federal High Court.</p>
<p><em>Section 46 of the Copyright Act</em> provides that “the Federal High Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction for the trial of offences or disputes under this Act”.</p>
<p><em>Section 67 of the Trademarks Act</em> in interpreting “court” as used under the Act states that “‘court’ means the Federal High Court”. The use of the word “means” is restrictive and admits of no other court or further inclusion.</p>
<p>Also, <em>section 32 of the Nigerian Patents and Designs Act</em> defines court to mean the Federal High Court.</p>
<p>Therefore, by these provisions it can safely be concluded that only the Federal High Court is bestowed with the jurisdiction to hear and determine causes and matters, whether criminal or civil, relating to intellectual property rights in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal, and ultimately the Supreme Court, exercise appellate jurisdiction in relation to matters emanating from the Federal High Court.</p>
<h3><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong></h3>
<p>There are several enforcement mechanisms an intellectual property right holder can employ in enforcing an intellectual property right.</p>
<p>These mechanisms include Alternative Dispute Resolution, Criminal Complaint and Civil Action via the courts.</p>
<p>In order to establish a breach of intellectual property right in a civil court, the claimant has to establish the followings:</p>
<p>(a) It is the owner of a copyrighted work, and</p>
<p>(b) The defendant has infringed its copyright</p>
<p>Upon the occurrence of any of the infringements, the intellectual property right owner may bring a lawsuit at the Federal High Court, which is the court that has jurisdiction to hear such matter against the violator.</p>
<p>The owner may be entitled to reliefs by way of damages, injunction, rendering of account and such relevant reliefs as the court may deem necessary in the circumstance.</p>
<p>Government responsibility in IPR comes in because of the criminalization of IPR infringement; it is an offence against the State to infringe someone’s else IPR.</p>
<h3>NATURE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENTS</h3>
<p>Section 21 of the Copyright Act provides for Civil and Criminal measures simultaneously in case of copyright infringement.</p>
<p>In the case of <strong><em>Anton Piller K.G. v. Manufacturing Processes Ltd</em>,</strong> known as Anton Piller Order, a plaintiff brought an ex parte application supported by an affidavit showing reasonable cause for suspecting the presence in any premises of items used or intends to be used for making infringing copies of his work, the order was granted and plaintiff was allowed to conduct a form of civil search different from criminal search usually conducted by the police in the premises of suspected person committing the infringement.</p>
<p>The court, if satisfied, may authorize the applicant to enter the premises at any reasonable time with an officer, not below the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police in pursuance of the order to seize, detain and preserve any infringing copy or contrivance and to inspect any or all documents in custody or under the control of the defendant.</p>
<p>The Trademarks Act provides mostly for the civil remedies for infringement. The rights conferred by the registration of a trademark on the proprietor are the right to exclusive use and the right to sue for infringement.</p>
<p>Therefore, registration is prima facie evidence of title to the particular trademark so registered and entitles the holder or owner of such mark to institute an action to protect its breach.</p>
<p>This exclusive right conferred under section 5(1) Trademarks Act is subject to any conditions and limitations to which the registration is subjected.</p>
<p>Sections 60 and 61 of the <strong>Trade Marks Act</strong> criminalize falsification of the register and false representation of a mark as registered.</p>
<p>The penalty for the latter is a fine of only Two Hundred Naira (₦200) and the former is imprisonment not exceeding seven years upon conviction. The Act does not impose any criminal sanction on infringement of trademarks.</p>
<h3>TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENTS UNDER THE CYBERCRIMES LAW</h3>
<p>However, The <strong>Cybercrimes(Prohibition, Prevention, E.T.C.) Act 2015</strong> imposes criminal action for unauthorized usage of trademark online. Section 25 of the Act provides as follows:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>&#8220;A person who, intentionally takes or makes use of a name, business name, trademark, domain name or other word or phrase registered, owned or in use by any individual, body corporate or belonging to either the Federal, State or Local Government in Nigeria, on the internet or any other computer network, without authority or right, and for the purpose of interfering with their use by the owner, registrant or legitimate prior user, commits an offence under this Act and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term of not more than 2 years or a fine of not more than =N5,000,000.00 or both&#8221;.</strong></em></p>
<h3>INFRINGEMENTS OF PATENTS AND DESIGNS</h3>
<p>The exploitative acts in relation to patents and designs can only amount to infringement when they are done for commercial or industrial purposes, doing any of the acts for personal or family use or for a gift to another does not amount to infringement.</p>
<p>Infringement of the rights of a patentee or design owner is actionable at the suit of the patentee or design owner as the case may be and in the event of being successful at the court, they are entitled to damages, injunction, accounts of profits or other similar orders the court may deem fit to make in such circumstance.</p>
<h3><strong>REMEDIES FOR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</strong></h3>
<p>The remedies available for the enforcement of intellectual property rights through the judicial process can be briefly highlighted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Order for inspection and seizure</strong>: an order authorizing the applicant to enter the premises at any reasonable time accompanied by a police officer, not below the rank of an Assistant Superintendent of Police; seize and detain and preserve any such infringing copy or contrivance; inspect all or any documents in the custody or under the control of the defendant relating to the action. Virtually all the laws governing intellectual property rights provide for this order.</li>
<li></li>
<li><strong>An order of injunction</strong>: this may include perpetual injunction, interlocutory injunction, Mareva injunction, and Anton pillar injunction. In <strong><em>Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co. AG v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry</em>, </strong>Lord Wilberforce stated, “<strong><em>the object of interlocutory injunction is to prevent a litigant who must necessarily suffer the law’s delay from losing by that delay the fruit of his litigation</em></strong>.” The whole idea is to freeze the situation before damages can flow, pending a subsequent trial on the merits.</li>
<li></li>
<li><strong>Award of damages</strong>: this is a pecuniary monetary satisfaction awarded by the court to the plaintiff for his financial loss occasioned by the infringement of his rights.</li>
<li></li>
<li><strong>The account of profits:</strong> this is to prevent unjust enrichment and it is not available to a plaintiff who has otherwise been adequately compensated in damages for the infringement.</li>
<li></li>
<li><strong>Delivery up:</strong> it is an order against the defendant to hand over all infringement articles to the plaintiff.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h3>
<p>Intellectual Property Rights are exclusive private proprietary rights granted by law to the owners thereof, over intangible assets, which are innovative products of the brain or the mind, as opposed to personal or real properties.</p>
<p>The primary function of intellectual property right under the law is to protect from exploitation the rights of a person’s work.</p>
<p>Enforcement of intellectual property rights can be carried out via administrative, regulatory, court and alternative dispute resolution methods, which is considered to be comprehensive and speedy in process.</p>
<p>However, the most effective method of intellectual property rights in Nigeria is through the judicial process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>TRADEMARK OPPOSITION PROCESS</strong></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>NOTICE OF OPPOSITION TRADEMARK</strong></h4>
<p>A trademark opposition in Nigeria is an administrative proceeding, similar to a civil federal lawsuit, before the Opposition Office at the <a href="http://www.iponigeria.com/#/">Trademark Registry</a> in which one party seeks to prevent another from registering a proposed or an accepted trademark.</p>
<p>A trademark is a branch of intellectual property that guarantees rights over goods and services of an owner against unfair imitation by other persons.  The object of most trademark laws, therefore, is to permit an enterprise by registering the mark to obtain an exclusive right to use the license and assigned mark</p>
<p>In our previous write-ups, we explained the procedures for registering a trademark in Nigeria.</p>
<p><strong>Laws Regulating Trademark Registration In Nigeria</strong></p>
<p>The laws governing trademark in Nigeria include the following;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade Marks Act, Cap T 13, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 (“TMA”);</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Trademark Regulations 1990;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Patents and Designs Act Cap. P2 LFN 2004</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FILING OF </strong><strong>TRADEMARK</strong> <strong>OPPOSITION</strong></p>
<p>A trademark opposition in Nigeria can be filed by any owner of an existing trademark who believes it would be damaged by the registration of an opposed mark. Such an opposer must file an opposition within two months from the date of publication of the application in the trademark journal.</p>
<p>The person or business filing the Notice of Opposition may be called the <strong>Opposer</strong> while the other party seeking to register the infringing mark is generally referred to as the <strong>Applicant</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>GROUNDS FOR FILING A NOTICE OF TRADEMARK OPPOSITION</strong></p>
<p>Filing a trademark opposition must be based on cogent grounds or reasons. The following are usual grounds by which a trademark opposition may be filed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The trademark is confusingly similar or identical to a previously registered trademark.</li>
<li>The trademark contains deceptive or scandalous matters or designs.</li>
<li>The trademark contains names of chemical substances, use of the Coat of Arms of Nigeria, use of any emblem or title such as President or Governor without appropriate authorization.</li>
<li>The trademark contains geographical names.</li>
<li>The trademark contains some restricted words and/or symbols.</li>
<li>The trademark is devoid of distinctive character.</li>
<li>The applicant of the trademark has no intention to use it.</li>
<li>The applicant is not the true owner entitled to register the trademark.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE FOR OPPOSING TRADEMARK APPLICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>Any interested party may file an objection by giving a notice of opposition within two months of the publication in the trademark journal, stating the ground(s) for the opposition. It is not possible to extend this two-month period. Under the Nigerian Trademarks Act, a party who is seeking to oppose a trademark application must do so in writing by filing a Notice of Opposition as provided for in <em>section 20(1)&amp; (2) </em>and payment of the prescribed filing fees.</p>
<p>The Registrar of Trademarks serves the notice of opposition on the applicant, who has one month to file a counter-statement.</p>
<p>Within one month of receipt of the applicant’s counter-statement, the opponent must file evidence in support of its opposition in the form of a statutory declaration. If the opponent does not file the evidence within the prescribed time period, the opposition is deemed abandoned.</p>
<p>Following the delivery of the opponent’s evidence, the applicant has one month to file its answering evidence. If he fails to do so, the application is deemed abandoned.</p>
<p>If the applicant sends such a counter-statement as aforesaid, the Registrar shall furnish a copy to the persons giving notice of opposition, and shall, after hearing the parties, if so required, and considering the evidence, decide whether, and subject to what conditions or limitations, if any, registration is to be permitted.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Section 20(5), it is worthy to note that the Registrar may request a person giving notice of opposition or an applicant sending a counter-statement after receipt of a copy of such a notice, to give security for costs of the proceedings before him relating to the opposition, and in default of such security being duly given may treat the opposition or application, as the case may be, as abandoned.</p>
<p>The opposition hearing takes place before the Registrar, who shall after hearing the parties and weighing the evidence, takes a decision.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the decision of the Registrar may be appealed to the Federal High Court.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>A Notice of Opposition is a complaint filed by the Opposer, who may allege several grounds for refusal of a trademark registration against the Applicant. The Notice must be filed within two months of publication of a trademark in the trademark journal. However, the owner of an infringed mark may have recourse to the action of Passing-Off where it failed to make a submission within the stipulated time frame for a Notice of Opposition against an infringement on its trademark.</p>
<p>After successfully filing the Notice of Opposition, duly stamped and paying the prescribed fees, the Registrar hears the parties and considers the evidence, if the Opposer prevails, the Applicant’s trademark application will be refused, resulting in the Applicant being unable to register the infringing trademark. However, if the Applicant prevails, the trademark shall be duly registered, and the certificate shall be issued to the Applicant upon application.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><strong> FILING FOR A PATENT IN NIGERIA</strong></p>



<p>Patents are exclusive monopoly rights granted by the Federal Government of Nigeria to an inventor, which preludes another inventor from exploiting the proprietor’s invention without his consent. Patents protect new inventions and cover how things work; what they do; how they do it; what they are made of and how they are made.</p>



<p>Patents are granted exclusively to a patentee for a period of 20 years from the date of filing the application. A Patent shall also lapse if the prescribed annual fees are not duly paid for in respect of it.</p>



<p>A patent application relates to only one application and for a Patent to be granted, it must satisfy the following requirements:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>the invention must be new.</strong></li>
<li><strong>involves an inventive step that is not obvious to anyone who has knowledge and experience in the subject.</strong></li>
<li><strong>it is capable of being used for industrial purposes and not be a mathematical or scientific discovery or method.</strong></li>
<li><strong>inventions must not be immoral or against public policy</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The Patents Registry, Commercial Law Department of the Federal Ministry of Industry administers the protection of Patents in Nigeria. The Legislation that governs the affairs and registration of patents in Nigeria is the <a href="https://lawcarenigeria.com/patents-and-designs-act/">Patents and Design Act 1971</a>. Patent applications are usually filed in the English Language in Nigeria.</p>



<p><strong>The requirement for Patent Registration </strong></p>



<p>Documents required for the registration of Patents in Nigeria are as follows:</p>



<ol>
<li>The inventor is required to bring a formal application that contains a petition or request made to the Registrar of the Trademarks, Patents, and Designs Registry signed by the Applicant or his Agent containing the following information:</li>
<li>Title of the Invention</li>
<li>Background history of the Invention</li>
<li>Specifications and claims of any number of processes with the means of working those processes start from general to specific.</li>
<li>The Detailed Description of the invention to be supported by drawings or illustrations if any.</li>
<li>Abstract.</li>
<li>Conclusion (what society/ mankind stands to gain from that field of an invention)</li>
</ol>



<ul>
<li>After filing the application for Patent, an official letter of acknowledgment that bears the application number, the official filing date of the application is generated and issued by the Registry to the Applicant.</li>
<li>The Patent application after the acknowledgment letter has been issued will be examined by the Registrar to ensure the application conforms with the Requirement of the Act that it contains the <strong>full name of the applicant; the address of the Applicant; the Email Address; Phone Number; Copy of Identification Card and Description of the Invention with any plans or drawings; and Claims</strong>.</li>
<li>Where the Registrar is satisfied that the application conforms to the requirements of the Act, the Patent will be granted.</li>
<li>Upon the grant of the Patent, the Patent Registrar shall issue, on behalf of the President of Nigeria, a Certificate that contains the following details:</li>
<li>Number of the patent in the order of grant</li>
<li>Name and address of the Patentee</li>
<li>The date of the Patent application and the grant</li>
<li>Number and date of the application on which the claim is based and the name of the country where it was made.</li>
<li>The description of the invention with the relevant plans and drawings.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cost of filing for Patent</strong></p>



<p>The cost of filing for a Patent at the Registry depends on the individual patent attorney appointed for the registration. By and large, Nigerian Patent Attorneys charge between <strong>N150, 000.00 ($420) to N250, 000 (about $700) </strong>for filing and professional fees to complete a single patent application.</p>



<p>However, a patent is a delicate application, it is important to appoint an only competent and authorized agent to file for the application and not rely on unaccredited middlemen, who have no knowledge of the application process. An incompetent patent application may be refused by the patent registry.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the registration of a Patent requires that the applicant must have invented certain ideas, which can be protected, and not just mere expression of it.</p>



<p>A patent issued by the Registry confers upon a Patentee the right to prevent any third party from doing, selling, importing or re-inventing the product or service for the purpose of sale or use without the consent of the Patentee. It also confers on the Patentee the legal right to challenge any unauthorized invention by a third party.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>SERVICE MARK REGISTRATION IN NIGERIA</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FIGURATIVE TRADEMARK REGISTRATION</strong></p>
<p>Registering service mark and figurative trademark in Nigeria underscores the protection of the registered mark against anyone who would intend to register an identical or similar mark or use the mark without the consent of the owner; it also connotes the protection, as it is a pre-requisite for the institution of infringement action under the Trade Mark Act where it has been illegally infringed upon.</p>
<p>Section 3 of the Trademark Act 1967 states that <strong><em>“no person shall be entitled to institute any proceedings to prevent or recover damages for an infringement of an unregistered trademark”</em></strong>. Going by this provision of the law cited, it can be inferred that for a proprietor to exercise a right over a trademark, it must be registered in respect of particular goods or services as provided under Section 4 of the Act.</p>
<p>A trademark, when registered in respect of particular goods or service, gives or is deemed to be given the exclusive right to use of the mark in respect to that goods, as provided under section 5 of the Act. And the right shall be deemed infringed by anyone not being the proprietor using it without the permission of the owner or uses a mark so resembling as is likely to deceive or cause confusion in the minds of the public.</p>
<p>There are several stages involved in registering a trademark, with each stage having its timeline.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step is to authorize an agent or lawyer for the registration by issuing a Power Of Attorney authorizing such an agent.</li>
<li>The first step is to conduct a search at the Trademark Registry in the appropriate class to check if the proposed mark sought to be registered is identical to an existing mark. This process can be concluded within two working days.</li>
<li>The next step is to file an application if the search is successful i.e. if there is no closely similar or conflicting mark registered in the same class.</li>
<li>Between 2- 3 weeks from the date of application, the application will move to the examination stage where it will be reviewed and the Registrar will give Notice of Acceptance to the applicant where the Registrar finds the trademark registrable. At this point, the trademark is deemed to have been duly registered.</li>
<li>Where the Proposed Trademark registered infringes on another existing mark or does not have a distinctive feature, the Registry will issue a Notice of Refusal instead or Acceptance Notice.</li>
<li>A trademark application is usually published in the Nigerian Trademark Journal for a period between 3-12 months depending on the backlog at the registry. When the mark is published, it is open for any opposition likely to be raised by the general public. The publication is for any proprietor of an existing trademark to raise an opposition within 2 months where the registered mark is identical to its own.</li>
<li>The final stage, which is the issuance of the Certificate is dependent on when the trademark is published in the Journal and opposition is raised. Where no opposition is raised within the specific period, the registrar will issue the Applicant with a Certificate of Registration within a period of 3 months after publication.</li>
<li>The Certificate of Registration grants the owner exclusive right of use of the trademark and it has the initial validity of seven (7) years and subsequent renewal for 14 years. There is no limitation as to the number of renewals that can be done on a mark. The renewal should be done 3 months before the expiration of the existing trademark.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a trademark to be registered, it must be distinctive and affixed to a product, registered in a particular class at the Trademark Registry for an initial period of 7 years from the date of application for submission, and subsequently and constantly be renewed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Trademark when registered grants to the proprietor exclusive rights to use his trademark in relation to the goods and services it was registered for and also institute an action in Court for the infringement made on such trademark or to prevent the unauthorized use of the mark (s). But in the case of an unregistered trademark, the owner can institute an action for passing off made on his mark.</p>
<p>Trademark infringement is the unauthorized and illegal use of a trademark without the consent of the proprietor of the mark, whereby it is used to cause confusion between the original mark and the mark used.</p>
<p>Section 5(1) of the Trademark Act 1967 provides for the exclusive right of a proprietor to use the trademark in respect of the goods it was registered for. Section 5(2) states that <strong><em>“without prejudice to the generality of the right to use a trademark, the marks shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who not being the proprietor of the trademark, uses a mark identical to it or so nearly resembling it as it is likely to deceive or cause confusion in cause of trade in relation to any goods in respect of which it was registered”.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Trademark Infringement</u></strong></p>
<p>For an action for infringement to succeed in court, the unauthorised use of the mark must be one likely to cause confusion in the minds of the consumers.</p>
<p>Section 9 of the Trademark Act provides for distinctiveness required for registration of a trademark. By that section, in order for a trademark to be registrable under part A of the Act, it must contain at least one of the following particulars:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must contain the name of a company, firm, individual presented in a special manner</li>
<li>The signature of the applicant of registration or some predecessor in the business</li>
<li>An invented word or words</li>
<li>A word that has no direct reference to the character or quality of the goods and not being according to its ordinary signification a geographical name or surname and</li>
<li>Any other distinctive mark</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the provision of Section 5 of the Act, an infringement of a registered trademark cannot be maintained unless the court finds that the defendant is engaged in the use of the mark identical with the registered trademark.</p>
<p>There are factors to be considered by the court before the action can succeed, which include the followings:</p>
<ol>
<li>The marks do not need to be identical before infringement can occur, rather there must be a similarity so great as to create a likelihood of confusion to a reasonable man.</li>
<li>The court will consider how widely known and recognized the plaintiff&#8217;s infringed mark is? And what strength does the plaintiff&#8217;s mark carry?</li>
<li>There must be evidence that the defendants mark caused confusion</li>
<li>The location of the business of the plaintiff and defendant and how careful consumers might be when considering both businesses. Is a consumer in the marketplace likely to be confused by the similar marks?</li>
<li>The court will consider the commercial value of the infringed mark and how it is likely to affect the brand of the plaintiff.</li>
<li>The court will also consider the intention of the defendant because the defendant could intentionally copy the plaintiff&#8217;s mark to divert their business. It will consider if the defendant was aware of the mark before infringing on it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This test was enunciated in the Supreme Court Case of <strong><u>Ferodo Limited v Ibeto Industries Limited 2004 LPELR </u></strong>where the plaintiff, an English company are the manufacturers of FERODO brand of brake linings for motor vehicles and it is sold in cardboard packages. They claimed in their suit that they had been using the marketing in the product in Nigeria for 10 years preceding the suit. The defendant is a Nigerian company that manufactures brake lines in the brand of UNION SUPA brake lines. The claim by the plaintiff was that the packaging of the defendant&#8217;s product was so similar to theirs, thereby constituting an infringement to their registered trademark.</p>
<p>It was observed that the defendant’s cardboard package was painted in red, black and white combination so closely resembling that of FERODO cardboard packaging. The defendants in their defence stated that their design box was not distinctive to the plaintiff alone but that the colour combination was traditional to the trade of brake linings. They also denied ever using the plaintiff&#8217;s Mark to pass off their product.</p>
<p>The trial judge held that the defendants UNION SUPA was far off the plaintiffs FERODO and does not in any way resemble the plaintiff&#8217;s mark and thereby found that there was no infringement. The matter was taken to the Court of Appeal, which also affirmed the decision of the trial judge stating that it is wrong to take two marks side by side to determine whether they are identical but rather the true test is whether a person who sees it or has seen the mark is likely to confuse it with an existing trademark as to confuse and create the impression that the proposed trademark is same as the existing one.</p>
<p>The Appellant still not satisfied with the judgement, further appealed to the Supreme Court where it was held in a leading judgment by Justice Dahiru Musdapher (J.S.C) that the appellants had not discharged the burden of proof placed on them by procedural law after dealing with the exhibits brought forward, the appeal lacked merits and that the appellant cannot succeed because there are clear differences between the two trademarks. The Supreme Court subsequently dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to enforce trademark rights</strong></p>
<p>Where a trademark has been infringed upon, the owner has several options available to enforce his rights. According to the provision of the Evidence Act, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff to prove that the trademark of the defendant is an infringement of its own. One of the processes of registering a trademark is that it must be published in the journal so that opposition to the registration of a mark similar to it can be raised timeously, within 2 months after the publication.</p>
<p><strong>Enforcement of Trademark rights</strong></p>
<p>The owner of a trademark who wishes to enforce its rights can explore the following options, but must do so timeously and aggressively:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the proprietor of the mark can file for opposition within 60 days of the publication in the trademark journal against the registration of a similar or identical mark, which is likely to cause confusion. This can be done by filing a Notice of Opposition and statutory declaration; the responding party will file a counter statement and the matter will be determined at a hearing before the Registrar.</li>
<li>Where the owner of a mark is aware of a likely infringement on its mark, the owner can apply to the court for a grant of search and seize orders. It gives the owner the right to raid the premises of the infringer without notice to seize all infringing goods found. The owner can collaborate with law enforcement agencies, NAFDAC or Nigerian Customs.</li>
<li>The proprietor of a mark can enforce its rights where it is made aware of a possible infringement to employ the services of private investigators to conduct an investigation on the premises of the infringer on whether they have stopped using the mark or is still passing off its mark.</li>
<li>The owner can also enforce its rights by writing a cease and desist letter to the infringer, but to make it more effective the letter can be backed by a valid court order.</li>
<li>The owner can also enforce its trademark by alerting the general public and consumers through the newspaper and various media forums, on who the real owners of the trademark are and how to recognise their genuine products.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remedies, which a court may be granted where a trademark has been infringed upon</strong></p>
<p>The Trademark Act LFN 1990 grants a proprietor a civil right of action to sue for any infringement made on its mark. The court that has the right to adjudicate on infringement related matters is the Federal High Court of Nigeria.</p>
<p>The following remedies may be sought by and granted to the Proprietor whose trademark is infringed:</p>
<ol>
<li>The owner can seek injunctive reliefs restraining the infringement and unauthorised use or sale of the trademarked items. Before this remedy is granted the court will consider the following:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The court will decide whether the plaintiff can succeed based on the merit of the case.</li>
<li>The court will consider whether the plaintiff has suffered irreparable damage</li>
<li>The court will consider how the injunction will affect both the plaintiff and the defendant.</li>
<li>The court will also consider if it is in the interest of the public to grant the injunction.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>The proprietor can seek for damages for compensation on the loss suffered resulting from the infringement and passing off of the actions of the infringing party, where the violation of their mark impacted negatively on the reputation of the plaintiff’s business. For damage to be awarded, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to prove that harm was caused by the infringement that led to consumers’ confusion and deception and sales were diverted from the plaintiff’s business. This can be backed by direct evidence of a consumer, testimony from the public or by circumstantial evidence.</li>
<li>The owner of the mark can seek an Anton Pillar Court order, which is also an injunctive relief made by ex-parte application, to enable access into the defendants’ premises for the purpose of taking possession of the infringed products or documents.</li>
<li>Another remedy granted to a plaintiff in an infringement matter is an order of account of profit to recoup all the profits made by the infringer from the unauthorized use of the trademark, especially in a commercialised industry where the defendant has made profits from using the trademark of the plaintiff to pass off products and the plaintiff suffered a gross loss of profit as a result of that act.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Conclusion</u></p>
<p>The trademark registry because of the numerous applications filed daily can sometimes be inadequate or make mistakes in the process of registration of trademarks, thereby leading to double applications or a situation where the registrar accepts a mark identical to an existing trademark.</p>
<p>As a result of this, it is important to emphasize that trademark goes beyond registering the mark and obtaining the Certificate of Registration; the proprietor must be alert and be on the lookout for any possible infringement likely to occur on its mark. Where an infringement occurs, the owner of the mark shall have a right to enforce its mark and may be entitled to the remedies or reliefs stated above.</p>
<p>Many proprietors of trademarks have had to fight and prosecute the unlawful use of their registered trademark in order to protect the integrity of their brands, as no responsible entity will allow an infringer pass off their products in their name or trademark.</p>
