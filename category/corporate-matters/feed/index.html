										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <strong><a href="http://cbn.gov.ng/">Central Bank of Nigeria</a></strong> says it has ended the sales of forex to Bureau De Change operators, saying the parallel market has become a conduit for illicit forex flows and graft.</p>
<p>The bank said it will also no longer process applications for BDC licences in the country.</p>
<p>Weekly sales of foreign exchange by the CBN will henceforth go directly to commercial banks, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, said Tuesday in a live TV broadcast after announcing that the bank has retained its benchmark policy rate.</p>
<p>“We are concerned that BDCs have allowed themselves to be used for graft,” Mr Emefiele said,.</p>
<p>He said international bodies, including some embassies and donor agencies, have been complicit in illegal forex transactions that have hindered the flow of foreign exchange into the country.</p>
<p>He said the organisations have chosen to channel forex through the black market than use the official Investors and Exporters (I&amp;E) window, called Nafex.</p>
<p>Mr Emefiele said the regulator will “deal ruthlessly” with banks allowing illegal forex dealers to use their platforms and will report the defaulting international organisations to their regulators.</p>
<p>“We will deal with them ruthlessly and we will report the international bodies,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Sales to Nigerians</strong></p>
<p>Accordingly, Mr Emefiele said banks are mandated to “immediately” and transparently sell forex to customers who present the required documents. All banks are to immeidtaely create dedicated tellers for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Cusromers not attended to by the banks are to report to the CBN through a toll free number: 0700 22 55 226 or email: cbd@cbn.gov.ng.</p>
<p>“This measure is not punitive on anyone, but it is to ensure the CBN is able to carry out its legitimate mandate of serving all Nigerians,” Mr Emefiele said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CAC SHARE CAPITAL THRESHOLD FOR COMPANY REGISTRATION ON NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>Persons interested in registering a company in certain industries and economic sectors in Nigeria are required by statutes and other regulations to have a minimum share capital threshold before such a company can be registered and deemed eligible to carry on business in those industries. The essence of this requirement is to determine the viability of the company as these industries are usually capital-intensive ventures and highly regulated.</p>
<p>Below is a list of these various industries and their requisite share capital threshold before they can be registered with CAC.</p>

<p>Furthermore, where a foreigner is to participate in a company, either as a shareholder and/or director, the Federal Ministry of Interior mandates such company to have a minimum share capital of N10,000,000 (Ten Million Naira) to make such company eligible to apply for and obtain expatriate quota, as well as business permit. Consequently, the  CAC requires companies with foreign participation to have at least N10,000,000 (Ten Million Naira) share capital before such a company can be registered.</p>
<p>Conclusively, certain industries mandates proposed participants to obtain an Approval-in-Principle from industry regulators before they can register a company in that industry with CAC. Such industries include banking, and payment service provides among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Under the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020, the owners of a defunct company may apply for striking OFF a defunct company from the Nigerian company register provided such a defunct company that has not commenced business and has no undischarged obligations</p>
<p>A defunct company under the Companies and Allied Matters Act is;</p>
<ol>
<li>A company that has not commenced business and has no undischarged obligations, or</li>
<li>A company which the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) observes or has reasonable cause to believe is not carrying on business or has not been in operation for ten (10) years or has not complied with the provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act for a consecutive period of ten (10) years.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Section 692 of the Companies and Allied Act, 2020(CAMA)</strong> makes provision for the power of the CAC to strike off the name of a defunct company from the Register of companies. The power can be exercised by the CAC suo motu or on an application to the CAC by the company in question.</p>
<p><strong>Section 692(1) of the CAMA</strong> makes provision for the procedure by which a defunct company who wishes for its name to be struck off the Companies Register can achieve the same. The procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A special resolution is passed by the members of the company at the general meeting stating that the name of the company is struck off the register.</li>
<li>Application is made to the CAC that the name of the company should be struck off the register. The application shall contain;</li>
<li>The reasons for the application, and</li>
<li>That the company has not commenced business and has no undischarged obligations.</li>
<li>Advertisement is made in three national daily newspapers within 28 days of the passing of the special resolution, calling for objections, if any, to the application.</li>
<li>The CAC may strike off the name of the company if it is satisfied that;</li>
<li>The reasons given for the application are sufficient to justify the striking off,</li>
<li>The company has not commenced business and has no undischarged obligations, and</li>
<li>No reasonable objection has been received within 28 days of the publication of the advertisement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where the company has been successfully struck off, the CAC shall publish in at least three (3) national daily newspapers the name of the company and the date of the striking off.</p>
<p>Any person aggrieved by the striking off of the name of a company may apply to the Federal High Court, at any time before the expiration of two (2) years from the date of the striking off, and if the Court is satisfied that it is just to restore the company to the register, the court may order that the name of the company be restored.</p>
<p>Also, the CAC has the power to Suo Motu strike off the name of a company from the register where it observes or has reasonable cause to believe, that the company is not carrying on business or has not been in operation for ten (10) years or has not complied with the provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act for a consecutive period of ten (10) years<strong>. Section 692(3), (4), and (5) of the CAMA</strong> provides for the procedure the CAC must follow;</p>
<ol>
<li>The CAC may publish in at least three (3) national daily newspapers, a notice of its intention to strike off the company from the register.</li>
<li>Where the CAC does not, within 90 days of the last publication receive any response from the company that it is still carrying on business or in operation, it may strike off the name of the company.</li>
<li>The CAC shall publish in at least three (3) national daily newspapers the name of the company and the date of the striking off.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any company, member, or creditor aggrieved by the striking off from the register by the CAC suo motu may apply to the court, at any time before the expiration of ten (10) years from the date of the publication.</p>
<p>Conclusively, it is worthy of note that where a company has been struck off, the liability, if any, of every director, managing officer, and member of the company shall continue and may be enforced as if the company has not been struck off. Also, the striking off of a company does not affect the power of the court to wind up such a company.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The general methods by which a Company’s securities can be offered to the public in Nigeria are through; Direct offer to the public, Offer for sale, Placing, Right issue, and Private placement. We shall briefly examine the procedure for private placement in Nigeria.</p>
<p>A private placement is a method of offering shares by a public company that is not quoted on the stock exchange or by a private company. As the name implies, a private placement is a special kind of offer whereby the securities of a company are sold to a specific or pre-arranged buyer(s).</p>
<p>The company involved here could be private or public while the security may be debt or equity. It is worthy of note, however, that private placements by private companies are not under the regulatory purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is the principal regulatory body tasked with the administration and regulation of company securities in Nigeria.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 339 of the Securities and Exchange Rules</strong>, defines Private placement to mean the issue of securities by a public company to select persons. <strong>Rule 340</strong> subsequently provides for the conditions a public company must fulfill for the approval of the offer by the SEC. it states that;</p>
<ol>
<li>No public company shall offer securities by way of private placement without the prior approval of the Commission.</li>
<li>Private placement by public companies shall be subject to the following conditions:-</li>
<li>The company shall show evidence of the dire need for fresh funds or technical expertise and shall satisfy the Commission that private placement remains the only viable option to achieving its objective.</li>
<li>The securities shall not be offered to more than 50 subscribers.</li>
<li>The resolution of the company authorizing the placement shall be Special as defined in the Companies and Allied Matters Act and shall state the number of shares to be offered and the price.</li>
<li>The notice of the general meeting authorizing the placement shall be published in two national daily newspapers and evidence of the publications shall be filed with the Commission.</li>
<li>The aggregate number of shares to be offered through private placement by a public quoted company shall be 30% of its existing issued and paid-up capital prior to the offer: Provided that where the company is ailing, it may offer a higher number of shares, subject to the approval of the Commission.</li>
<li>The price of the securities of the company, if quoted, shall be on technical suspension during the period of placement.</li>
<li>The offer shall be for a period as proposed by the issuer and approved by the Commission but not exceeding ten (10) working days: Provided that the Commission may extend the period under special circumstances.</li>
<li>All subsequent capital raising shall be approved only upon satisfactory account of utilization of previous issue proceeds.</li>
<li>Private Placements shall not be advertised, mentioned and/or discussed in the print and electronic media. Approval of a private placement may be suspended or withdrawn for violation of this rule. Any Capital Market Operator engaged in an advisory role on the private placement may also be sanctioned.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission’s involvement in Private Placement by Private Companies is limited except where the Private  Company issues any form of application to be completed on deposit of money, then it will be deemed to be an invitation to the public to acquire shares or deposit money by <strong>Section 69 (3) the Investment and Securities Act</strong>. With regards to a private placement by private companies, SEC needs not to be informed unless the shares would eventually get into the hands of the public.</p>
<p>For a public company, the procedure for private placement is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Board of Directors of the company passes a resolution to hold a general meeting to authorize the placement and publish a notice of the general meeting in two national daily newspapers.</li>
<li>Publication of notice of the general meeting authorizing the placement in two national daily newspapers</li>
<li>The special resolution of the company authorizing the placement and stating the number of shares to be offered and the price is passed by members at the general meeting.</li>
<li>Ensure compliance with the requirements of Rule 340 SEC Rules.</li>
<li>Application to SEC for approval to carry out private placement with the following documents attached:</li>
<li>Evidence of dire need of fresh funds or technical expertise and shall satisfy the Commission that private placement remains the only viable option to achieving its objective.</li>
<li>Evidence of the notice of the general meeting authorizing the placement published in two national daily newspapers.</li>
<li>Special resolution of the company authorizing the placement and stating the number of shares to be offered and the price.</li>
<li>Any other required document by the regulators.</li>
<li>The offer is made for the prospective subscribers not exceeding fifty (50) persons and for a period not exceeding ten(10) working days or a period approved by the SEC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, failure to comply with the privacy policy of the SEC as enshrined in <strong>Rule 341 of the SEC Rules </strong>may lead to suspension or withdrawal of the approval and any Capital Market Operator engaged in an advisory role on the private placement may also be sanctioned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020 (CAMA) has made provisions to protect the information of individuals specified by them as private or restricted. This is laudable, considering the recent trends of data breaches, identity theft, fraud which are enhanced by having access to such information and laws enforcing privacy and data protection. Sections 323-329 of CAMA 2020 and Regulations 15 and 16 of the Companies Regulation 2020 contain the guidelines on the restriction of personal and protected information.</p>
<p>This article will give a brief overview of the categories of personal and protected information, instances where one can apply for such information to be protected, and permitted disclosure of such information.</p>
<p><strong><u>Categories of Personal and Protected Information     </u></strong></p>
<p>The Nigerian Data Protection Regulation 2019 defines personal information as any information that can be used either directly or indirectly to identify a natural person and includes name, identification number, location data, photo, medical information, IP address, Phone number, etc.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note, that CAMA 2020 only provides for restriction as to use and disclosure of “protected information”. Section 323 of CAMA 2020 states such information to include:</p>
<ol>
<li>A company director’s usual residential address</li>
<li>A company director’s service address which is his usual residential address.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, there is no inclusion of other personal information apart from the address in the category of protected information. However, the Companies Regulation in Regulations 15 refers to personal information. Although it does not also define what constitutes personal information. Sub 4 of the regulation states that the Commission can decline to issue certified true copies of documents that contain information as to:</p>
<ol>
<li>The actual date of birth</li>
<li>Signature</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Identification Number of an individual.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Condition Precedent to Restriction of Use and Disclosure of Protected Information</u></strong></p>
<p>Regulation 15 of the Companies Regulation 2020 stipulates the condition precedent that must be fulfilled before personal or protected information can be restricted from use and disclosure.</p>
<p>It provides that a director can apply for such if he or someone living with him is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under threat of imminent danger to life</li>
<li>Is a target of activists</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is active in the defence industry, security or law enforcement agency</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is a traceable supplier to the defence industry, security or law enforcement agency</li>
<li>Their safety would be compromised.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such application must be accompanied by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extract of police diary where there have attacks in the past</li>
<li>Documentary evidence of a threat or imminent attack</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Evidence of engagement in the defence industry, security or law enforcement agency which puts a person at risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>A piece of personal and protected information does not acquire the status of being restricted from disclosure automatically, rather it must be applied for and accompanied with proof of why its disclosure must be restricted.</p>
<p><strong><u>Permitted Disclosure of Personal and Protected Information</u></strong></p>
<p>There are certain entities and instances where such information can be disclosed regardless of the restriction placed.  They include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Public authorities, which are defined to include any person or body having functions of a public nature</li>
<li>A company can disclose such information to communicate with the director concerned, to comply with the provisions of the Act in terms of particulars to be sent to the registrar and in compliance with the Commission&#8217;s decision to put the address on the public record. Sections 324 and 328 CAMA 2020</li>
<li>Where the director consents to the disclosure of such information. Section 324(2) CAMA 2020.</li>
<li>Disclosure to a credit reference agency: The Minister is empowered to make regulations restricting disclosure of protected information to such agency as well as guidelines in making an application for disclosure.</li>
<li>Pursuant to a Court Order: A court can make an order directed at the company or Commission to disclose protected information if it is satisfied that:
<ul>
<li>the service address of the director other than his usual residential address is not effective to bring documents to his notice</li>
<li>it is necessary to enforce an order or decree of a court. This application can be made by a liquidator, creditor, member of the company or any other person the court deems to have sufficient interest. The order must also specify the persons the information should be disclosed to and the purpose of the disclosure. Section 327 of CAMA 2020.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disclosure by the Commission in a public record where communications sent by the Commission to the director remain unanswered and evidence that the service address for documents is not effective to bring them to his notice. The Commission is required to notify the director of such a proposal and the director cannot use a different address other than his usual residential address for 5 years from the date of the Committee’s decision. Section 329 of CAMA 2020.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, protected information is only disclosed where justifiable reasons have been provided and proved. Currently, the CAC allows individuals to restrict the residential address of the company’s directors or business owners for the sum of <strong>N25,000 (Twenty Five Thousand Naira).</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BUSINESS AGREEMENT IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT</strong></p>
<p>A business agreement is entered into or created by parties who are desirous of entering into a business relationship to accomplish a specific task or business goal while retaining their separate identities.  Parties to a business transaction negotiate terms and conditions of their transaction and execute a formally binding agreement to set out the rights, obligations, and relationship of the parties prior to the performance as it reflects the understanding of parties.</p>
<p>An example of a form of business agreement executed between parties is a Memorandum of Understanding. There are varying reasons why individuals and corporate entities create a Memorandum of Understanding, it could be for the purpose of accessing a new emerging market, to gain profits margins by combining their assets and operations, accessing skills and capabilities, or to share risk for major investments or projects.</p>
<p>There is also a Joint Venture Agreement where parties have shared ownership, shared governance, shared profit returns, and risk. For individuals, where two or more persons come together to form a temporary partnership or joint undertaking for the purpose of performing a particular project that partnership can be called a Joint venture Contract.</p>
<p>A business agreement can also be in form of a partnership agreement, sale and purchase agreement, and commercial lease agreement.</p>
<p>A business agreement is duly required when express and implied terms and obligations have been agreed upon by parties, it is important for the smooth operation of the business transaction. It also guarantees clarity on the purpose of the business agreement. There is no specific format for which a business agreement is drafted; however, there are salient terms that form the basis of the agreement.</p>
<p><strong>The structures for which business agreement are drafted are;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full details and particulars of parties to the business agreement which can also be inclusive of any sub-agreement arrangements, so it is evident who is responsible for performing obligations under the agreement.</li>
<li>The term duration of the business agreement is the date of commencement of the agreement and its duration which is subject to the agreement of parties.</li>
<li>Definition of any key terms to be used in the business agreement.</li>
<li>The full description of the services or goods to be provided or received in the course of the business arrangement or the rights and obligations of each party.</li>
<li>The payment details and date, which includes interest owned by parties to the agreement, installment, or methods of payments should also be clearly stated to avoid disagreements</li>
<li>Profits and expenses, the net distribution of profits, losses, and disbursement to be borne out of the business agreement.</li>
<li>The powers to be exercised with the consent of the parties (where applicable).</li>
<li>Confidentiality clause especially where sensitive ideas, knowledge, information, and resources are shared that are confidential and not privy to a third party.</li>
<li>Dispute resolution clause is also an important clause that must be included in a business agreement in the eventuality of disputes likely to arise, the means by which it will be resolved by employing the dispute resolution mechanism of arbitration, mediation, or negotiation instead of going to court.</li>
<li>The termination clause is also an important element found in the business agreement stating the terms and circumstances of determining the business relationship and the manner of distributing proceed upon determination of the contract.</li>
<li>The governing law of the business agreement should be stated, especially if the parties are located in different states, parties can negotiate on the state&#8217;s law that will apply to the agreement.</li>
<li>Any special terms and conditions to be agreed to by parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally<strong>, </strong>parties to a business agreement can either be individuals or corporate entities. It is important that the terms and obligations are documented for it to be enforceable.</p>
<p>Before entering into any business agreement, it is advisable that a business lawyer is engaged to review or analyze the agreement to ensure it meets all standard legal requirements.</p>

<p>The body or agency of government responsible for issuing Tax Clearance in Nigeria is the <a href="https://www.firs.gov.ng/SiteApplication/Home/Home.aspx">Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS)</a> at the federal level for only companies; also the State Inland Revenue Services at the state levels for individuals.</p>
<h5><strong>APPLICATION FOR TAX CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE</strong></h5>
<p>Upon obtaining TIN, the company can now apply for the Tax Clearance Certificate by filling the tax clearance form which would be three. The applicant must fill the questionnaires with the FIRS for new taxpayers on the company’s letterhead, and this would be addressed to the tax controller accompanied by relevant documents.</p>
<p>The existing companies can only make an application for a Tax Clearance Certificate after the company’s audited report has been submitted and all outstanding taxes have been paid.</p>
<h5>WHO CAN OBTAIN A TAX CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE?</h5>
<p>A tax clearance certificate can be obtained by an individual or a company. A tax clearance certificate is issued in arrears over a course of three years. You need to have rendered your tax returns to the relevant authority over the course of three years to be eligible for a tax clearance certificate in Nigeria.</p>
<h5><strong>USAGES OF TAX CLEARANCE CERTIFICATES IN NIGERIA</strong></h5>
<p>Apart from the fact that the government clearly make use of  tax paid for the betterment of the society, such as provisions of good roads, and constant electricity, and also the fact that one can be punished for not paying tax under the law, there are several other benefits to be derived from paying taxes and obtaining Tax Clearance Certificate evidencing it, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>To apply for a trade license such as NUPRC &amp; NCC License</li>
<li>To apply for contracts from the government or agencies of the government and government-owned companies</li>
<li>To process an import or export license</li>
<li>For the processing of a gaming license</li>
<li>Usually required to stand as a surety for a person on bail</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>It is important to state further that all FIRS&#8217;s Tax Clearance Certificates in Nigeria are issued to cover arrears of three taxable years. The fact that a company is new does not exempt such a company from obtaining a Tax Clearance Certificate. In such a circumstance, the Tax Clearance Certificate will clearly indicate “NIL”, which implies such a company does not own taxes for the period before its formation.</p>
<p>The TCC is issued by FIRS for companies, while the States Internal Revenue Services issue similar Tax Clearance for individual taxpayers within their respective states.</p>

<p>A non disclosure agreement in Nigeria also known as Confidentiality Agreement is a legal contract or agreement between parties with the sole purpose of legally forbidding parties from disclosing confidential information that has been shared together in the course of a commercial or employment relationship to any third party.  It signifies that a confidential relationship exists between parties involved.</p>



<p>The non-disclosure agreement (NDA) may be used by organizations that are considering doing business together to restrict the use or disclosure of confidential information shared in the course of the business.  NDA is also commonly used in an employee-employer relationship where employees need to have access to confidential information in course of their employment and the employer prepares a non-disclosure agreement to prevent the use or disclosure of the information for any other purpose.</p>



<p><strong>Types of non-disclosure agreement</strong></p>



<p>A non-disclosure agreement can be either a Unilateral Agreement or a Mutual Agreement, which is dependent on which party is providing the secret information.</p>



<p>A unilateral Non-disclosure agreement is a one-way agreement where only one party in the business relationship will be provided with the information to be protected. It is designed to stipulate the duties and obligations of one party to the agreement. This is usually used in an employee-employer relationship.</p>



<p>A mutual Non-disclosure agreement is a type of agreement where the information provided will be shared between the parties. The agreement will clearly set out the confidential information that parties wish to share between them and restrict their use and access to third parties.</p>



<p><strong>The relevance of Non-disclosure agreement</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>It is used to define confidential information that can be disclosed and what information cannot be disclosed.</li>
<li>It is used to protect information from being disclosed</li>
<li>It also sets out the consequences of a breach of the non-disclosure agreement</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Clauses in a Non-disclosure agreement</strong></p>



<p>It is important to note some important clauses that must be present in a non-disclosure agreement and its importance in a commercial transaction.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Parties Clause:</strong> for clarity purposes, the full name of parties and their addresses must be properly described in the agreement. Where the information will be obliged to a third party, the full name and description of the third party must be included for clarity purposes.</li>
<li><strong>The definition of the Confidential Information:</strong> the parties to the agreement must state what confidential information means. The definition must cover as much information as the non-disclosure agreement must not be vague.</li>
<li><strong>The obligation of the receiving party:</strong> this clause must state that the main obligation of the receiving party in the agreement is to keep all information secret as well as the other party in the agreement.</li>
<li><strong>The term of the agreement:</strong> the importance of this clause is to ensure that all terms in the agreement are expressly stated and no implied terms are included. The duration of the agreement which is determined by the termination clause must be stated and the period in which parties may disclose information after the relationship has terminated must also be expressly stated.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusion clause:</strong> this clause provides for information that is not expected to be kept secret. The recipient party is also allowed to disclose information required by law and also when the party is obliged to do so. It must also state the complete description of cases where restrictions on disclosure are not applicable</li>
</ol>



<p>A non-disclosure agreement is as binding as a contractual agreement and it gives assurance that where there is a breach of the agreement by one party, the other party can seek redress for damages resulting from the disclosed information.</p>



<p>There are other reliefs available to an aggrieved party where there is a breach of the confidentiality agreement such as Account for profit, where the defaulting party is to account for profit made from the breach and Injunctive relief.</p>



<p>Finally, it noteworthy that an NDA imposes an obligation on parties to it, and confidential agreement can be included in the main contractual agreement or as a stand-alone agreement.</p>

<h3 class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><strong>IMPORT PROCEDURE IN NIGERIA</strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO OBTAIN IMPORT LICENSE IN NIGERIA</strong></p>



<p>An Import license in Nigeria is the approval issued by the various agencies of government, which regulate and determine the goods that can be brought into the country.</p>



<p><strong>Import Procedure in Nigeria</strong></p>



<p>Before any goods can be imported in commercial quantities into Nigeria, the importer must essentially follow the stipulated statutory requirements, which include the followings:</p>



<ul>
<li>The importer must register a company in Nigeria and obtain the certificate of incorporation from the Corporate Affairs Commission.</li>
<li>The next step is to register the Nigerian company with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and obtain the Tax Identification Number (TIN Number) for proof of tax payment with a valid email address tagged to it.</li>
<li>The importer must also open a bank account with a reputable bank in Nigeria to act as the Authorized Dealer Bank (ADB). The bank will issue a Form-M /PAAR which is mandatory documentation required by the Federal Government through the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to monitor, keep track of goods imported into the country and facilitate payment of import duties.</li>
<li>The importer will also be required to obtain the appropriate permit from regulatory agencies such as SONCAP (Standard Organization of Nigeria Conformity Assessment Programme), NAFDAC (National Agency for Food Drug and Administrative Control), DPR (Department of Petroleum Resources), NERC (Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission) and among other relevant regulatory agencies.</li>
<li>The importer must also register as a client at the Nigeria Single Window Trade Portal, which is an intergovernmental site that encourages trade procedures between the government agencies and parties on the Federal Inland Revenue site.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Government Agencies that regulate &amp; Issue Import Licenses in Nigeria</strong></p>



<p><strong>Standard Organization of Nigeria (SON):</strong> This agency is foremost when it comes to importation in Nigeria. The SON operates and issues licenses to importers of various goods through its program called <strong>SONCAP (Standard Organization of Nigeria Conformity Assessment Programme)</strong>. The SON covers almost all items to be imported into Nigeria save for the ones statutorily delegated to other agencies.</p>



<p><strong>The Documents and Procedure to process SONCAP in Nigeria </strong></p>



<p>The documents required to import goods into Nigeria is dependent on the nature of goods to be imported. If the product to be imported is SON regulated, the importer will be required to get the Product Certificate from the manufacturer country, which is issued by an approved inspection agency. The product certificate will be required by the importer to open the Form M.</p>



<p><strong>National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC): </strong>This is an agency of the Ministry of Health in Nigeria. The products that are regulated by NAFDAC are Food products, Drugs, Chemicals, Medical products, Raw Materials, and other branded products exempted from registering with SONCAP.</p>



<p>In our previous write up, we explained the procedure for obtaining the Import license from NAFDAC.</p>



<p><strong>Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR)</strong>: for the importation of petroleum resources into Nigeria, the agency responsible for issuance of the import permit is the Department of Petroleum Resources.</p>



<p>The application process from the Agency for the DPR import permit can be applied for on the online portal of the DPR official website.</p>



<p><strong>Nigerian Electrification Regulatory Commission (NERC):</strong> the NERC import permit required from all importers participating in the power sector in Nigeria. The NERC is the regulatory agency that oversees the power sector in Nigeria.</p>



<p><strong>Nigeria Agricultural Quarantine Services (NAQS</strong>): This regulatory agency under the Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for issuing importation permits for agricultural seeds and animals into the Nigerian territory.</p>



<p>The requirements for obtaining import license with NAQS</p>



<ul>
<li>Apply for the import permit to the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Federal Department of Veterinary and Pest Control Services</li>
<li>Notify the agency of the import permit details</li>
<li>Notify the agency of the arrival date of the products</li>
<li>On arrival at the point of entry, the importer is to make a declaration of animal or animal products for consignment inspection and certification.</li>
<li>NAQS officials will inspect and verify the consignment and documents submitted at the point of entry.</li>
<li>If the consignment complies with the standard of the agency, the importer will be made to pay the requisite fees for further action.</li>
</ul>



<p>In conclusion, there is no generic import license that covers all goods brought into Nigeria. The goods to be imported will determine the import license to be required. There are various government agencies responsible for issuing import permits and licenses to importers for the various categories of goods to be brought into Nigeria.</p>



<p>Before an import permit is obtained, there are questions to be asked to determine which agency will be responsible for issuing the necessary permit for the goods to be imported.</p>



<p>It should also be noted that not all goods can be imported into Nigeria territory. Some items, which cannot be imported into Nigeria at the moment, are clearly listed on the Nigerian Customs Service’s list of contraband items.</p>
