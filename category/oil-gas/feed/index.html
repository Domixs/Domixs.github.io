										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Petroleum industry Act (PIA) was officially signed into law on the 16 of August 2021 by the President of Nigeria. The Act provides for legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian Petroleum Industry and development of Host Communities and related matters. It contains 5 Chapters, 319 Sections and, 8 Schedules dealing with Rights of Preemption; Incorporated Joint Ventures; Domestic Base Price and Pricing Framework; Pricing Formula for Gas Price for the Gas Based Industries; Capital Allowances; Production Allowances and Cost Price Ratio Limit; Petroleum Fees, Rents and Royalty; and Creation of the Ministry of Petroleum Incorporated. We shall briefly summarize the basic features of the Act.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the Act focuses on Governance and Institution, the Act vests the ownership of petroleum within Nigeria in the Federal Government. The Act creates two regulatory bodies, known as the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of upstream petroleum operations and the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (the ‘Authority) responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of the midstream and downstream operations.</p>
<p>The Act also provides for the incorporation within 6 months from commencement of the Act of a commercial and profitable oriented limited Liability company under Companies and Allied Matter Act to replace the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), it is to be known as The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, all shares are to be held by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Petroleum in equal portions on behalf of the federation. NNPC Limited is to pay its share of all fees, rents, royalties, profit oil shares, taxes, and other required payments to the Government as any other company in Nigeria and that it should pay out the bulk of its profits as dividends after retaining 25% for reinvestment.</p>
<p>The Minister of petroleum and the Minister of Finance shall within 18 months of the effective date determine the assets, after which such assets, interests, and liabilities of NNPC are to be transferred to NNPC Limited or its subsidiaries,  assets or liability not transferred shall remain the assets, interests, and liabilities of NNPC until they become extinguished or transferred to the Government and Six months following the determination of such assets the Minister of Finance and the Attorney-General of the Federation shall develop a framework for the payment of the liabilities not transferred to NNPC Limited and if such assets, interests, and liabilities are not transferred within the stipulated period, all the assets, interests, liabilities of NNPC is deemed to be transferred to NNPC Limited and NNPC shall cease to exist.</p>
<p>Section 52 of the Act establishes the Midstream and Downstream Gas Infrastructure Fund, the major source of funding for the Midstream and Downstream Gas Infrastructure Fund is a 0.5% levy on the wholesale price of petroleum products and natural gas produced and sold in Nigeria. Interestingly, Section 65 of the Act encourages NNPC Ltd and its joint venture partners to explore the use of incorporated joint venture companies.</p>
<p>The second chapter of the Act focuses on general administration, the main objective of the Act is to promote the exploration and exploitation of petroleum resources for the benefit of Nigerians, promote sustainable development, encourage and facilitate both local and foreign investment, ensure safe, efficient transportation and distribution infrastructure, avoid market distortions and ensure a competitive market for the sale and distribution of petroleum products and natural gas in Nigeria; and avoid cross-subsidies among different categories of consumers, and is built on the tenets of effectiveness, efficiency, accountability, competitiveness, safety, conducive business environment.</p>
<p>The Act establishes new Licenses and Leases, which include the Petroleum Exploration Licence, Petroleum Prospecting Licence (PPL), and Petroleum Mining Lease (PML). All the existing licenses and leases would be automatically converted to PPLs and PMLs upon their expiration, however, the Act allows holders of Oil Prospecting Licences and Oil Mining Leases under the current regime to voluntarily covert them to PPLs or PMLs after fulfilling some condition precedent.</p>
<p>The Commission is required to develop a model license and model lease which shall be incorporated into contracts before such can be approved, and to include a carried interest provision giving NNPC Limited the right to participate up to 60% in a contract.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 of the Act introduces the Petroleum Host Community Development (PHCD) which has the main objectives to wit: to foster sustainable prosperity within host communities, provide direct social and economic benefits and enhance harmonious co-existence. Section 240 of the Act went further to make provision for the host communities development trust fund and how it is to be funded, each settlor is to contribute 3% of its actual operating expenditure in the upstream petroleum operations in the preceding calendar year, it may also be funded by donations, gifts, grants or honoraria and interests accruing to the Trust’s reserve fund. The Fund is tax-exempt and contributions by settlors are tax-deductible. The Board of trustees and executive members of the management committee may include persons of high integrity and professional standing who may not necessarily come from the host communities.</p>
<p>The Board of trustees are to allocate available funds contributed to trust yearly, in the following ratio- 75% for capital projects, 20% as a reserve, and 5% for administrative expenses, however, a community will forfeit the cost of repairs in the event of vandalism, sabotage and other civil unrest causing damage to petroleum facilities or disruption of production activities.</p>
<p>Chapter four focuses on the fiscal framework, the key objectives are establishing a forward-looking fiscal framework that encourages investment, dynamism, clarity, enhances revenues for the government while ensuring a fair return for investors, promotes equity and transparency. The Federal Inland Revenue Service is charged with the administration and collection of revenue such as Hydrocarbon Tax of 15% &#8211; 30% on profits from crude oil production, Company income Tax at 30%, Education Tax at 2% which will no longer be tax-deductible, rents, royalties, and production shares, while The Authority is responsible for collecting gas flare penalty from midstream operations.</p>
<p>The Act has significantly increased the general penalty for late filing of returns, late filing of tax returns will attract N10million on the first day and N2million for each subsequent day the failure continues.</p>
<p>Chapter Five is the miscellaneous provisions, it makes provisions for legal proceedings, the Act repealed 10 laws, they include the Associated Gas Reinjection Act, Hydrocarbon Oil Refineries Act, Motor Spirit Act, NNPC (Projects) Act, NNPC Act (once NNPC ceases to exist) Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency Act, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (Management Board, etc.) Act, Petroleum Profit Tax Act, and Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract Act. It went further to amend The Pre-Shipment Inspection of Oil Exports Act and Petroleum Equalization Fund while the provisions of some extant laws will still apply until termination or expiration of the relevant oil prospecting licenses and mining leases, these include The Petroleum Act, PPTA, Oil Pipelines Act, Deep Offshore and Inland Basin PSC Act.</p>
<p>In Conclusion, the Act has completely changed the oil and gas administration and governance in Nigeria. The government agencies such as the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and the current <a href="https://www.nnpcgroup.com/Pages/Home.aspx">NNPC</a>, which have been abolished by virtue of the Act will gradually transition to a new agency &amp; entity respectively in accordance with the provisions of the PIA 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Oil and Gas sector serves as a major source of revenue in Nigeria. Any person intending to start an oil and gas business in Nigeria must comply with certain legal requirements. This write-up will give a breakdown of the step-by-step procedure necessary to set up an oil and gas business in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The following steps must be followed to start an oil and gas company in Nigeria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Registration of Company</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Registration at Corporate Affairs Commission</strong></p>
<p>This applies to all businesses owned by nationals, foreigners or both. The Companies and Allied Matters requires all businesses to be registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). The process is seamless and carried out online by accredited agents of the CAC. This enables the business to acquire a separate legal entity through which it can sue and be sued and acquire a property. The documents given to the company upon registration ensure legitimacy and builds trust among its customers. They also serve as primary documents requested for during contracts or when opening a bank account. One could also register as an enterprise (business name). However, this would limit the type of permit it can be granted to carry out certain activities in the oil and gas sector.</p>
<p><strong>Registration at National Investment Promotion Commission</strong></p>
<p>This is only required for businesses having foreign participation. Every company with foreign ownership is required by the National Investment Promotion Commission Act to register with the NIPC before commencing business in Nigeria upon incorporation at the CAC.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Tax Registration &amp; Obtaining Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC)</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is pertinent for a company intending to engage in the oil and gas business to register with the nearest branch of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and obtain a Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC). The Tax Clearance Certificate simply proves that the Company’s tax affairs for the preceding year are in order with no outstanding unpaid taxes. One of the benefits of having a TCC is that it is an important requirement to process any permit in the oil and gas industry.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Registration with the Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF)</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This scheme was established to cater to employee’s welfare. It protects private-sector employees from financial difficulties in the event of old age, invalidity, cessation of employment, and death which is paid to them or their survivors. Being a requirement for obtaining a license to operate in the petroleum sector in Nigeria, entities engaged in this business must register with NSITF and make monthly contributions towards the pension or retirement benefits and compensation for other work-related accidents</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Obtain a Permit/License</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Obtain a Department of Petroleum Resources Permit</strong></p>
<p>This is a department under the Ministry of Petroleum Resources (DPR) charged with the responsibility to provide regulatory guidelines across the entire oil and gas value chain in Nigeria. Application for all licenses in the oil and gas sector is sought for and obtained before any person or entity can carry out any operations therein. The DPR issues 3 categories of permits in the Oil &amp; Gas Industry (OGISP) section depending on the service the company intends to provide. The categories of licenses are General, Major and Specialized purpose. The documents required to process the permits include incorporation/registration documents given at the point of Incorporation Documents, Tax Clearance Certificate, Employee Compensation Scheme (NSITF), List of Equipment available to the Company, Details of Staff, Evidence of Medical Retainership with a hospital, Company’s Profile etc.</p>
<p>The documents and the fee charged differ for each category of license sought for.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Register with Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) </u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The NCDMB was established in 2010 by the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Development Act. Registration for the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Joint Qualification System is imperative as it consolidates data on all major activities in the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry. The Board monitors the oil and gas sector to ensure compliance with Nigerian Content provisions and among others targets capacity-building interventions that will deepen indigenous capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Obtain the Industrial Training Fund Certificate </u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The ITF requires employers with a minimum of N50, 000, 000 (Fifty Million Naira) turnover or having more than 5 employees to contribute to the fund at the rate of 1% of the company employees’ payroll. Suppliers, contractors or consultants who bid for contracts from government agencies or private companies are required to make this contribution as well. Thus, a company intending to provide a service in the oil and gas sector must obtain this certificate to evidence its contribution to the fun, which is utilized to promote and encourage the acquisition of skills in industry and commerce with a view of generating a pool of indigenous trained manpower sufficient to meet the growing needs of the economy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Registration for Pension </u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The pension registration can be done with any Pension Fund Administrators (PFA) in Nigeria. Although it is not compulsory unless the company intends to register with the Nigerian Petroleum Exchange or has more than 5 employees. However, it is advisable company register their staff, to enable them to save for pensions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Register with Nigerian Petroleum Exchange and Production Companies </u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Register with Nigerian Petroleum Exchange</strong></p>
<p>This step is not compulsory but advisable if the company intends to participate in bidding platforms for major contracts. This can be avoided if the company only engages in minor contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Register with Production Companies</strong></p>
<p>This is paramount to access the petroleum products intended to be sold and work with the major oil-producing companies, especially the International Oil Companies (IOC). The production companies include Total, Shell, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, there are various business opportunities in the oil and gas sector that one can engage in, depending on one&#8217;s capital or expertise. Regardless, to engage in any oil and gas activities in Nigeria, it is advisable to register an entity first, and when a company has been registered, it is mandatory to obtain appropriate licensing from the <a href="https://www.dpr.gov.ng/index.php">DPR</a> and any other relevant regulatory agencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO START AN OIL SERVICING COMPANY IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>The petroleum sector is one of the highly regulated sectors in Nigeria, and as such, every entity intending to engage in such sector must be duly licensed to do so. The procedure to start an oil service company in Nigeria starts with the incorporation of such an entity and obtaining a requisite license in Nigeria. The steps to start an oil &amp; gas service company shall be discussed briefly below.</p>
<p><strong>The steps for starting an oil and gas service company are</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorporation of Company</strong>&#8211; the first step to starting an oil service company in Nigeria is to incorporate the company with the Corporate Affairs Commission. This incorporation is regulated by the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), 2020 (as amended). Only companies incorporated in Nigeria are allowed to engage in the exploration, production, and distribution of oil and gas in the petroleum sector of the Nigerian economy. Every foreign company seeking to carry out oil services in Nigeria must also register in Nigeria exempt such a company has been exempted by the Federal Government by the provisions of CAMA.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain the Company&#8217;s Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC)</strong>&#8211; this certificate is an important and compulsory certification for operating an oil service company in Nigeria. It is issued by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to evidence that the company’s tax affairs for the preceding years are in order. Even where the company is newly registered, the TCC must be obtained by the company.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain the Department of Petroleum Resources Permit</strong>&#8211; Some various permits or licenses must be obtained from the Department of Petroleum Resources before the commencement of operation as an oil services company. Some of the relevant permits are Oil &amp; Gas Industry Permit (OGSIP), which are three categories namely; general, major, or specialized, depending on the specific service the oil servicing company intends to provide. For companies that intend to offer oil and gas services on the offshore, they are required to obtain the Offshore Safety Permit (OSP). The application for the OGSIP permit must be accompanied by the required information and documents such as TCC, Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) payment receipt among others.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain the Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF)- </strong>The Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund is targeted at protecting private-sector employees and their dependents from financial difficulties in the event of either disease, injury, or death associated with the employee’s employment. The NSITF is also one of the requirements to obtain the DPR Permit.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain the Industrial Training Fund (ITF) Certificate</strong>– this certificate is one of the important documentation required to be obtained to start an oil service company in Nigeria. The purpose of registering with ITF is for promoting the acquisition of relevant skills in industry or commerce to generate a pool of indigenous manpower to satisfy the needs of the economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Employers that are liable to make contributions under the Fund are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employers having five (5) or more employees in their establishment;</li>
<li>Employers who have less than five (5) employees but having a turnover of N50 million and above per annum;</li>
<li>Suppliers, Contractors or Consultants who bid for contracts from any federal government agency or parastatals or private companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registration with the National Pension Commission</strong>&#8211; this step is not compulsory for new oil service companies whose staff strength is below five (5). The certificate is obtained when the oil service company is making employee contributions. Although the registration with PENCOM serves as a pre-requisite to register with Nigerian Petroleum Exchange.</li>
<li><strong>Register with the Nigerian Petroleum Exchange (NIPEX)</strong>&#8211; obtaining NIPEX is an important requirement in the oil and gas industry. Major contracts and jobs are obtained and completed in NIPEX bidding platforms in Nigeria. It is important to state that oil service companies can carry on their business for some time without registering with NIPEX simply because some minor jobs and contracts can be offered without going through the NIPEX bidding system.</li>
<li><strong>Registration with Production Companies</strong>&#8211; To start an oil servicing company in Nigeria, most oil and gas production companies such as SHELL, TOTAL, NLNG, etc, will require registration with them before oil services can be rendered to them. The time frame for registration with these production companies differs from one production organization to another.</li>
<li><strong>Registration with the Local Content Board (NCDMB)</strong>&#8211; to operate an oil service company, it is crucial to register for Nigerian Oil &amp; Gas Industry Content Joint Qualification System (NOGIC-JQS) with the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB). Essentially, the NOGIC-JQS is a data consolidation on all major activities in the Nigerian oil and gas industry. Under the NOGIC Act, the NCDMB must ensure local talents are engaged in oil and gas sector, and the majority stakes in any upstream oil service company are held by Nigerian citizens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Oil service companies are essential to the upstream sector of the oil &amp; gas industry, as they provide services such as constructing rigs, designing pipes and pipelines, carrying out technical, mechanical, engineering, construction works, which range from mechanical, electrical, carpentry down to supplies among other functions. Under Nigerian law, it is an offense to engage in any oil &amp; gas services without the appropriate permit or license.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NNPC has begun to show its books to members of the public, an act that should increase its efficiency and transparency.</p>
<p>The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had in the past been associated with allegations of corrupt practices across its operations.</p>
<p>For instance, at the request of the federal government in 2010, two audit firms, KPMG and S.S. Afemikhe &amp; Co (SSA) conducted a process and forensic review of its businesses chiefly to establish the accuracy of reported crude oil and gas revenues which accrued to it between 2007 and 2009.</p>
<p>The firms were also to find out the underlining reasons for major inaccuracies in its accounts, and the officials of the corporation involved in such irregularities, as well as review the governance and institutional arrangements used by the corporation for managing oil revenues.</p>
<p>KPMG and SSA were then, equally asked by the government through the Ministry of Finance to carry out an assessment of deductions made by the NNPC including petrol subsidy and joint venture cash calls before remitting to the Federation Account, the components of NNPC’s operating and capital expenditure between 2007 and 2009, and the discrepancies between reported and declared revenue receipts from the corporation.</p>
<p>In addition, the government had then further requested as part of the auditing pair’s terms of reference, to define and map out the processes and procedures by which the NNPC computed, determined, and remitted revenues to it, review the volumetric data involved in the computation of crude oil and gas revenues to validate export and domestic crude oil volumes and their values, as well as review a sample of past transactions of the corporation for accuracy, validity, appropriateness, and efficiency in its processes.</p>
<p>From their findings which was handed to the government, the audit team then discovered that on the back of the corporation’s inefficiencies, Nigeria had, “no centralized location for storing electronic copies of historical (oil) production and allocation data,” and that this information was stored on personnel workstations, indicating that in event of staff turnover or system failure, vital historical production data would be lost.</p>
<p>They also established that the corporation recorded significant underpayment of domestic crude oil cost against the federation account being that it often used exchange rates below that which the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) published, even though its invoices for domestic crude oil allocated to it were in dollar rates.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the audit process had then highlighted the unwholesome practice of renewing crude oil sales contracts on an annual basis without standard processes as well as the evaluating such contracts for renewal on unclear terms.</p>
<p>While observing NNPC’s systemic accommodation of illegal crude oil off-takers in its contract schedule, the 2010 audit equally found that reconciliation of payments for oil sales was often delayed by the corporation, and this left the country and its subnational entities in distress.</p>
<p>However, nine years after the report was submitted to the government, a new head, Mallam Mele Kyari, was appointed for the NNPC in July 2019, and while promptly admitting that the corporation had run its operations with little care for accountability, he promised some sweeping changes in its processes.</p>
<p>Kyari had told journalists at the State House shortly after his appointment that, “there is no corruption where there is no discretion; we will work with the EFCC to take out discretion in our system.” Months down the line, he had made some bold steps to suggest that he meant his earliest remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Picking transparency as a bedrock</strong></p>
<p>He had said in his maiden address where he disclosed his plans for the NNPC, that an operational model comprising “Transparency, Accountability and Performance Excellence (TAPE)” would be adopted to make the corporation accountable to Nigerians.</p>
<p>Kyari inferred that the best route to productivity for the NNPC was for it to open itself up for public scrutiny by making its operations and processes transparent to the country.<br />
He proposed that the new system will run alongside well-defined operational processes that are benchmarked against standard industry practices and that the corporation will restructure its operational costs to give value for every money it spends.</p>
<p>Perhaps equally acknowledging transparency as a workplace virtue which smoothens operations, forces realistic goal-setting habit, makes compliance a lot easier, fosters employee harmony, throws up better candidates and ideas from across the board, and ultimately produces more profits from improved productivity, Kyari stated that he will prioritize it in his management of the NNPC.</p>
<p>With this, he opted to end the corporation’s age-long character of hiding the inefficiencies of its workforce from Nigerians. Months from when he pushed the NNPC on this route, the corporation has made defining efforts at transparency including publishing audited financial statements of its headquarters and subsidiaries operations in 2018 and 2019, and from which their combined quoted losses dropped from N803 billion to N1.7 billion.</p>
<p>Besides completing its financial audits, the NNPC also moved away from the old-styled process of secretly submitting its financial books to only statutory agencies such as the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation amongst others, to publishing it for Nigerians and relevant business interests to see, study and interrogate. This from existing records was previously almost impossible especially with regards to questions about the status of its refineries in Warri, Port Harcourt, and Kaduna.</p>
<p>In its 2019 audited financial statement which was recently published, the corporation unusually moved the needle on its habitually huge general administrative expenses from N894 billion that it was in 2018 to N696 billion in 2019, showing an adjustment of 22 percent and its ambition on cost optimization.</p>
<p>The majority of its subsidiaries, except the decrepit refineries which it explained, have remained shuttered for rehabilitation, also recorded healthy profit margins; according to the financial statement, the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) recorded N479 billion profit in 2019 compared to N179 billion in 2018 while the Integrated Data Services Limited (IDSL) had N23 billion profit in 2019 compared to the N154 million it made in 2018.<br />
The Pipeline and Products Marketing Company (PPMC) it stated recorded a N14.2 billion profit in 2019 compared to the N9.3 billion it made in 2018. And NNPC’s monthly remittances to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) are also published for public assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Further steps on transparency</strong></p>
<p>Moving on, the NNPC further underlined its commitment to transparent business practices and enrolled to observe the ideals espoused by the global Extractive Industries Transparency Initiatives (EITI), in which EITI-supporting oil companies are tasked to do more to disclose its operations to the public.</p>
<p>Over 65 extractives companies, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), commodity traders, financial institutions, and industry partners including the NNPC have committed to observing the principles of transparent business operations advocated by the EITI and will always publicly promote transparency throughout the extractive industries, help public debate and provide opportunities for sustainable development.</p>
<p>As a guiding principle, the NNPC and other supporting companies will publicly disclose taxes and payments they make to relevant authorities and vendors, and where they choose not to, will have to state why they chose not to follow the expectations or process.<br />
It will also as an EITI-supporting corporation, ensure comprehensive disclosure of taxes and payments made to all EITI implementing countries and publicly disclose beneficial owners as well as take steps initiated to identify the beneficial owners of its direct business partners, including Joint Ventures (JV) operators and contractors.</p>
<p>During procurement processes such as tender for a lifting of Nigeria’s oil, construction, and repair of pipelines amongst others, the NNPC will also have to engage rigorous procurement processes, including due diligence with respect to partners and vendors.</p>
<p>Additionally, it will support the operationalization of the decision by EITI-complaint countries to disclose future licenses and contracts entered into that govern the exploration and exploitation of oil, gas, and minerals in accordance with recommendations in the EITI Standard.</p>
<p>The EITI in its guidelines for this stated that it expects companies which sign up to be its supporting member to, “recognize that achievement of greater transparency must be set in the context of respect for contracts and laws in accordance with the EITI Principles.”<br />
It explained that it wants to see, “companies working together with governments to deliver natural resources in a manner that benefits societies and communities,” by ensuring that their processes are appropriate to deliver the data required for high standards of accountability.</p>
<p>Kyari, in this regard,  stated the commitment of the NNPC to further transparency and accountability to the people of Nigeria whose common trust the corporation had lost from its years of underhand business practices.</p>
<p>“Becoming an EITI supporting company aligns with NNPC’s corporate vision and principles of transparency, accountability, and performance excellence.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with NEITI and EITI strengthens our commitment towards commodity trading transparency, contract transparency, and systematic disclosure of revenues and payments.</p>
<p>“We are on a journey towards greater transparency and look forward to deepening our collaboration with the EITI to further this work,” Kyari said with optimism when he led the corporation to sign up for the EITI process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marketers of petroleum products in the country have continued to highlight the negative impact of the long delay in passing the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) on the downstream sector of the nation’s oil industry.</p>
<p>Precisely, they said the failure to pass the all-important bill into law for decades has resulted in a loss of appetite to invest in the digitalization of their vital downstream assets.</p>
<p>The marketers, who spoke at the just ended virtual Oil Trading &amp; Logistics Conference (OTL) Africa Downstream Week, however, acknowledged the pivotal role technology plays in the future of storage, pipelines, and coastal assets.</p>
<p>Speaking at the conference on the topic: “The Future of Storage and Pipeline Assets”, the Chief Operating Officer of OVH Energy Marketing, Mr. Mumuni Dagazau, said the delayed PIB was responsible for a dearth of investments in downstream infrastructure in Nigeria.</p>
<p>“The PIB has been dangled for quite a while whereas its passage will create a lot of confidence for investment, not only in technology but in the development of physical infrastructure as well.</p>
<p>“Due to a delay in the passage of the PIB, there is a lack of confidence in the downstream sector in terms of investment requirements,” he said.</p>
<p>Dagazau stated that reality has revealed the need for rapid development of technology in the downstream oil and gas sector, not only for the protection of petroleum assets but for efficiency and speed in making decisions for both the private and public sectors in the downstream industry.</p>
<p>Outlining the drivers of technology in the downstream industry, Dagazau noted that with what had been deployed so far, one could easily tell where operators’ concerns lie.</p>
<p>“Technology is deployed for several reasons and one such is to manage storage facilities, coordinate supply planning, promote business efficiency, and optimizing transportation.<br />
“One of the biggest problems we have is that we need to develop manpower as quickly as we develop the technology. These two literally go hand in hand,” he said.</p>
<p>Dagazau also identified the cost implication of adopting technology for downstream operations as another reason technology is not being deployed as quickly as the industry would like to see.</p>
<p>According to him, “Technology is not cheap, but if we are able to, through other means, reduce cost in taxes and support the oil and gas sector, we will witness a quick upscale of technologies in the sector.”</p>
<p>The COO noted that in addition to the disruptions caused by the PIB, the industry also had issues with compatibility between technology and infrastructure.</p>
<p>He explained that this was because technology has to match infrastructure to give the cost-benefit.</p>
<p>Also contributing, the Chairman, Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPMMAN), Mrs. Winifred Akpani, stated that most downstream oil companies had still not deployed technology or digitalized their operations.</p>
<p>She noted that even for some companies where the technology had been acquired, there was still a lot being done manually.</p>
<p>“For something as simple as measuring what you have in your tank, we still do tank dipping in this day and age, which ordinarily shouldn’t be”, she said.</p>
<p>Akpani, who is also the Chief Executive Officer of Northwest Petroleum &amp; Gas Company, confirmed the availability of asset management systems that could be deployed to achieve the efficient management of downstream petroleum assets.</p>
<p>“Supervision and asset monitoring is very important, we also have geographic information systems, and supervisory control. Others include data acquisition and terminal management solutions introduced by Siemens,” the DAPPMA boss said.</p>
<p>While noting that investments in storage capacity for white products had peaked in Nigeria, Akpani encouraged her counterparts to embark on strategic digitalization of their downstream petroleum assets in order to boost profitability and promote asset integrity.</p>
<p>The marketers also at the session, advocated for the decentralization of petroleum depots from Lagos, pointing out that the concentration of facilities in the state had proven counterproductive to the environment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>NCDMB</strong> <strong>EXPATRIATE</strong> <strong>QUOTA APPROVAL</strong></p>
<p>Companies seeking to engage expatriates in the Nigerian oil and gas industry must obtain the relevant approvals from the Nigerian Content Development &amp; Monitoring Board (NCDMB) before applying for Expatriate quota, Temporary Work Permit, or other entry permits from the Ministry of Interior, the Nigeria Immigration Service or other agencies of government.</p>

<p>Biometric data of all expatriate staff is to be captured by the Board within a month of their entry into the country for new quota positions, this is to create a database of all expatriates, as well as a tool for monitoring expatriate utilization in the Nigerian Oil and Gas industry. Also, every other requirement of the Board regulating Expatriates Staff must be adhered to because the renewal of quota positions will be dependent on the compliance level of the company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In closing, the government through the Act provided for the development of Nigerian content in the Nigerian oil and gas industry. This is to ensure Nigerians are given the first consideration for employment in any project executed by any operator or project promoter in the Nigerian oil and gas industry, given that this is an effective way of developing the capacity of Nigerian in the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>OIL AND GAS POLICIES IN NIGERIA </strong></h4>
<p>There are various laws regulating oil and gas in Nigeria. The principals among these laws are the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria (as amended) and the Petroleum Act, which vested ownership and control of oil found anywhere in Nigeria in the Federal Government. This includes oil located within any land in Nigeria, under its territorial waters, continental shelf or within its exclusive economic zone. Government participation in the oil &amp; gas industry is through the National Oil Company, the <a href="https://www.nnpcgroup.com/Pages/Home.aspx">Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).</a></p>
<p>Nigeria has 10 pieces of legislation, excluding regulations and directives, regulating various aspects of the oil industry. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) pending before the National Assembly aims to harmonize all the legislations and significantly restructures the industry, particularly the functions of the various regulatory agencies, with a view to eliminating overlaps. The draft law, among other objectives, aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sweeping reforms by repealing laws like the Petroleum Act 1969.</li>
<li>Create new institutions to govern the operations of the industry, incorporation, and privatization of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).</li>
<li>Transform the existing unincorporated joint ventures between the multinational oil companies and the NNPC into incorporated joint ventures.</li>
</ul>
<p>In an attempt to secure the passage of the bill, the government has divided the bill and intends to pass it in phases. The first one is the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill. The aims of the bills are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a framework for the creation of commercially oriented and profit-driven petroleum entities.</li>
<li>Ensure value is added and the international best practice of the petroleum industry is adopted.</li>
<li>Promote transparency in administering petroleum resources</li>
<li>Create an environment that allows petroleum industry operation</li>
</ul>
<p>The upstream sector, the most active sector of the Nigerian petroleum industry, is largely export-focused and until recently dominated exclusively by international oil companies. The Nigerian government&#8217;s marginal fields licensing regime and its local content development drive have led to increased participation of indigenous oil companies in the petroleum industry.</p>
<p>The Constitution vests ownership of mineral resources, including oil and gas, exclusively in the federal government and further confers on the federal government the exclusive power to make laws and regulations for the governance of the industry.</p>
<p>Apart from the 1999 Constitution, the other legislations impacting, governing, and regulating the oil &amp; gas sector in Nigeria are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Petroleum Act and the Schedules and Regulations made pursuant to it: the laws provide the framework for the licensing of oil and gas companies to engage in activities connected with the exploration, production, and transportation of crude oil;</li>
<li>The Petroleum Profits Tax Act: it provides the framework under which the federal government obtains revenue from oil and gas operations by way of signature bonuses, royalties, and taxes;</li>
<li>The Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Act: this Act gives incentives to oil and gas companies operating in the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin areas under Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs).</li>
<li>The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Act: the Act establishes the NNPC and empowering it to participate directly in petroleum operations on behalf of the federal government;</li>
<li>The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act – providing the framework for assessing the impact of oil and gas projects on the environment;</li>
<li>The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) Establishment Act 2007 – detailing the statutory powers of the FIRS to collect all taxes, fees, levies, royalties, rents, signature bonuses, penalties for gas flaring, depot fees, including fees for oil prospecting licenses, oil mining licenses, etc.;</li>
<li>The Education Tax Act – it provides for the imposition of annual taxes of 2 percent of assessable profits on oil and gas companies for the development of Nigeria&#8217;s educational sector;</li>
<li>The Niger Delta Development Commission (Establishment) Act – it mandates the payment to the Commission by oil and gas companies of 3 percent of their annual budgets for the development of the Niger Delta areas where oil and gas are exploited;</li>
<li>The Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act 2010: it provides a framework for promoting the participation of Nigerians in the oil and gas industry and laying down the minimum thresholds for local contents utilized in the sector;</li>
<li>The Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative Act 2007: it provides the framework for transparency and accountability by imposing reporting and disclosure obligations on all oil and gas companies upon requirement by NEITI of revenue due to or paid to the federal government;</li>
<li>National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (Establishment) Act: it establishes the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), which coordinates and implements the National Oil spill Contingency Plan (NOSCP) for Nigeria.</li>
<li>The Oil Pipelines Act; and</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Regulations:</strong></p>
<p>The legal framework regulating the oil sector in Nigeria is based on several laws. The Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources has primary responsibility for policy direction and exercises supervisory oversight over the industry. The Minister of Petroleum Resources (the Minister) issues regulations, guidelines, and directives pursuant to the Petroleum Act and other enabling laws. The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) is responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of the petroleum industry and for supervising all petroleum industry operations such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitors the operations of oil companies,</li>
<li>Sets and enforces environmental standards.</li>
<li>Collects royalty and rents.</li>
<li>Supervises and ensures compliance with oil industry regulations.</li>
<li>Issues licenses and permits.</li>
<li>Ensures the protection of all oil and gas investments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other important regulatory agencies include the Federal Ministry of the Environment (FME), Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), and the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA).</p>
<p>The government participates in oil and gas operations through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation by adopting various contractual models for the development of oil and gas resources (such as concession agreements, traditional joint venture agreements, service contracts, production sharing contracts, and sole-risk contracts).</p>
<p>The licensing regime under the Petroleum Act provides for the following Licenses:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Oil Exploration License (OEL</strong>)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a non-exclusive license that permits a licensee to explore for petroleum in the licensed area. The OEL does not confer a right to an oil prospecting license (OPL) or an oil mining lease (OML). It is granted for one year and is renewable upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Due to modern technology available in the oil &amp; gas industry, the government rarely issues this license again.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Oil Prospecting License (OPL)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This grants the licensee the exclusive right to explore and prospect for petroleum and allows the licensee to carry away and dispose of petroleum won during prospecting operations subject to fulfillment of obligations imposed under the Act, by the Petroleum Profits Tax Act or other law imposing taxes on petroleum. The duration is determined by the Minister and it usually issued for a period not exceeding 5 years for onshore areas and shallow waters areas, while an OPL for Deep Offshore and Inland Basins issued for 10 years.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Oil Mining Lease (OML)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is granted only to the holder of an OPL upon satisfaction of all conditions of the license or the Act and having discovered oil in commercial quantity (currently defined as a flow rate of 10,000bpd). The lease confers on the holder the exclusive right to search for, win, work, carry away, and dispose of petroleum within the specified acreage for a period of 20 years. This may be renewed subject to the fulfillment of prescribed conditions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are several laws regulating the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. This is because the oil &amp; gas is very critical to the Nigerian economy; the earnings from oil &amp; gas export is up to 90% of the total export earnings of the government. The most recent and radical of the laws is the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act 2010 and following regulations and presidential directives, which mandates compulsory participation of Nigerian citizens in the upstream sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A joint venture is a business entity/ agreement entered into or created by two or more parties to accomplish a specific task or business goal while retaining their separate identities. There are varying reasons why companies create a joint venture agreement, it could be for the purpose of accessing a new emerging market; to gain profits margins by combining their assets and operations; accessing skills and capabilities, or to share the risk for major investments or projects. This concept makes it similar to a partnership where every risk, finance, profits are shared. The difference between a partnership and a Joint venture contract is the duration. A partnership exists as long as possible while a Joint Venture is terminated once the purpose it was created for has been realized or extinguished.</p>
<p>In a joint venture there is usually shared ownership, shared governance, shared profit returns and risk. For individuals, where two or more persons come together to form a temporary partnership or joint undertaking for the purpose of performing a particular project that partnership can be called a Joint venture Contract.</p>
<p>In the ordinary parlance there are steps to a Joint Venture Contract in Nigeria, which includes having to define the business strategy to be undertaking; selecting the partners after due diligence in checking their credentials; develop a joint venture deal that negotiates all terms and conditions; planning; and execution of the Joint Venture Contract. A distinct characteristic of a Joint Venture is that it is for a specific period of time, for example, in the oil and gas supply business, once the purpose is achieved, liabilities are discharged and profit is shared; and then the venture is extinguished.</p>
<p>The purpose of a Joint Venture is that every business or person has the strength, resources and advantage to deliver what is required for the effective delivery of a product or service to the market to foster economic relationships. Joint venture contract in Nigeria can be created in these instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>A foreign investor buying an interest in a local company in Nigeria</li>
<li>A local company buying an interest in an existing foreign company</li>
<li>Both local and foreign companies joining to form a new enterprise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Relevant Clauses or Terms in Joint Venture Contract/Agreement</u></strong></p>
<p>A contract is duly required when a joint venture has been agreed upon. This is important for the smooth running of the venture. It guarantees clarity on the purpose of the joint venture, the parties, the rights of the parties, and the duties expected of each party. Below is the list of terms to be found in the Joint Venture contract.</p>
<ul>
<li>Name in which the joint venture business is to be conducted</li>
<li>The principal office of business which most often is the registered address of a company</li>
<li>The term duration of the contract is the date of commencement of the agreement and its duration which is subject to the disposal of the venture and satisfaction of all debts.</li>
<li>The purpose of which the business is formed, it also restricts the joint venture to just that business except there is consent to do otherwise.</li>
<li>The initial capital to be contributed by each partner according to his percentage interest, loans etc.</li>
<li>Interest owned by each partner in the joint venture should also be clearly stated to avoid disagreements</li>
<li>Profits and expenses- the net distribution of profits, losses and disbursement to be borne out of the joint venture.</li>
<li>The powers to be exercised with the consent of the partners such as the power to borrow, third-party obligations, the power to acquire property and the power to sell or mortgage.</li>
<li>Transfer of interest, where the parties agree that the joint venture is precluded from selling, assigning transferring any interest in the joint venture without the consent of parties, it should be clearly expressed in the contract.</li>
<li>Legal Title to the Joint Venture assets usually remains in the name of the joint venture where applicable</li>
<li>A confidentiality agreement, which is one of the most important clauses in a Joint venture Contract in Nigeria. In a Joint venture, ideas, knowledge, information and resources are shared that are confidential and not privy to a third party. This information is assets to parties concerned. So it is important to protect ones’ ideas/information by an agreement stating that during and after the duration of the Joint Venture, all confidential information be treated as a secret and not disclosed to any person except under very strict terms and conditions.</li>
<li>Arbitration clause: this is also an important clause that must be found in a Joint venture Contract, especially where a business transaction is to be brokered. There are expectations of disputes likely to arise and arbitration should be provided for, upon agreement on the arbitrator or an arbitration panel, country, place and who would constitute the arbitration.</li>
<li>Termination of a Joint venture: it is also an important element found in the contract stating the liquidation of the Venture and the manner of distributing proceeds upon determination of the contract.</li>
<li>Governing law: this is important since a joint venture may involve parties from different countries and jurisdictions. The need to know the law applicable and the court to have jurisdiction over the agreement is sacrosanct.</li>
</ul>
<p>A joint venture is a common form of foreign investment in Nigeria. Parties to a joint venture agreement in Nigeria can be individuals or incorporated bodies. It is very important that the various aspects listed above are carefully documented. A Joint venture agreement is entered into before the company is incorporated. It outlines the terms of the Joint Venture which forms the basis of the memorandum and Article of association of the proposed company.</p>
<p>Parties should ensure that the important clauses of the Joint Venture agreement such as sharing formula, management structure, obligations of the parties, termination, governing laws are entrenched into the joint venture contracts to make it legally binding on parties.</p>
