										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The jurisdiction of the Federal High Court is enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), which provides for the judiciary arm of Government (the Courts). <strong>Section 249 (1)</strong> of the Constitution created the Federal High Court, which is the third-highest court in the hierarchy of courts in Nigeria. The Federal High Court Act 1973 regulates and governs matters relating to the court.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the Federal High Court is the inherent power and extent of the powers of the Federal High Court to determine a civil and criminal proceeding instituted before it. The jurisdiction of the court is provided in <strong>Section 251</strong> of the Constitution, which will be highlighted below.</p>
<p><strong>Structure and Organization</strong></p>
<p>The Federal High Court is composed of the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court and any number of Judges of the Federal High Court as may be prescribed by the Act of National Assembly as stated in <strong>Section 249</strong> of the Constitution. The Federal High Court Act provides that the Federal High Court shall consist of the Chief Judge and fifty (50) Judges of the Court.</p>
<p>The appointment of a person to the office of the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court is made by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council (NJC), subject to the confirmation of the Senate as provided in <strong>Section 250</strong> of the Constitution. The appointments of Judges are made by the President on the recommendation of the NJC.</p>
<p>The Constitution further states that a person will not be qualified to hold the office of the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court unless he is a qualified legal practitioner for not less than ten (10) years.</p>
<p><strong>Jurisdiction of the Federal High Court</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 251(1)</strong> of the Constitution highlights the powers of the Federal High Court to determine legal matters and the extent of these powers as conferred by the Constitution and the Act of the National Assembly.

<p>The Federal High Court also has jurisdiction and powers in respect of treason, treasonable felony, and allied offenses as stated in <strong>Section 251(2).</strong> It also exercises jurisdiction and powers in respect of criminal causes and matters in respect of all matters listed above in section 251(1) of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The National Assembly may also by law make provisions to confer upon the Federal High Court additional powers as may appear necessary or desirable for enabling the Court more effectively to exercise its jurisdiction. The various legislations, which have conferred or widened the jurisdictions of the Federal High Court among others include the Federal High Court Act; Copyright Act; Trade Marks Act; Admiralty Jurisdiction Act; Companies and Allied Matters Act; and Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act.</p>
<p>With respect to the constitution of the Federal High Court to have jurisdiction to determine a matter, <strong>Section 253 </strong>of the Constitution provides that <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>the Federal High Court</em></strong> <strong><em>shall be duly constituted if it consists of at least one Judge of the Court</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The Federal High Court is a superior court of record in Nigeria and it has coordinate jurisdiction with the High Courts of various states of the Federation as conferred upon it by the provisions of the Constitution. Although the Federal High Court has various judicial divisions across many states in Nigeria, it is considered a single court.</p>
