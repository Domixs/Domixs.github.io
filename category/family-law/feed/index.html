										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LAWS OF DIVORCE IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>Divorce is a legal means of bringing a statutory marriage to an end through the court system and for a marriage to undergo divorce proceedings in the High Court, such marriage must be one of those governed by the Matrimonial Causes Act LFN 2004 (the Act), such as marriages conducted in a licensed place of worship, a registrar’s office and marriage under special license and evidenced by a valid Marriage Certificate.</p>
<p>The Matrimonial Causes Act LFN 2004 (S.11) directs the court not to grant divorce petitions quickly and instead to encourage couples to try reconciliation. The law also requires the court to first act as a conciliator, attempting to reconcile the marriage.</p>
<p><strong>WHICH COURT HAS THE JURISDICTION TO DETERMINE THE DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE?</strong></p>
<p>Any High Court of any State of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory has jurisdiction to determine a petition for dissolution of marriage. Thus, no matter which state where the marriage is conducted, jurisdiction is nationwide and divorce proceedings can be commenced in any state. Furthermore, for a court to have jurisdiction over a petition for dissolution of marriage, one of the parties must be a Nigerian citizen (not overseas) or have a domicile in Nigeria. For the purposes of domicile, Nigeria is treated as a single federation entity. As a result, a person who is domiciled in any state of the Federation is regarded to be domiciled in Nigeria and can file a divorce petition in any state in the country, regardless of whether he or she is domiciled there or elsewhere.</p>
<p>The court has the authority to transfer a divorce case filed in a State High Court to any other State High Court in the Federation under the rule of &#8220;forum convenience,&#8221; particularly if it is in the interests of justice to have the case heard in the other State or if the other party has no objection.</p>
<p><strong>GROUNDS</strong> <strong>FOR</strong> <strong>DIVORCE</strong> <strong>IN</strong> <strong>NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>The primary ground for divorce in Nigeria is that <strong>the marriage has broken down irretrievably</strong>. This is the provision of s.15 of the Matrimonial Cause Act LFN 2004.</p>
<p>The expression &#8220;broken down irretrievably&#8221; suggests that there is nothing that can be done to make the marriage work again, and divorce is the only option.</p>
<p>Flowing from that singular ground, the Act in section 15(2) specifies the reasons why a marriage would be considered to have broken down irretrievably as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a partner is unfaithful, and the other partner cannot tolerate the extramarital affairs can be a reason for divorce.</li>
<li>When a partner is denying the other partner sex or lovemaking or when one partner due to mental or health conditions cannot grant sex or sexually satisfy the other partner can be a valid ground for divorce. This is called the inability to consummate the marriage.</li>
<li>When a partner exhibits a character that is annoying to the other partner that the other partner can no longer tolerate, the habit can be a valid reason for a partner to file for divorce. For instance, a wife can file for divorce on the grounds that the man is a serial drunkard.</li>
<li>When a partner has deserted the marriage or left the other partner and becomes incommunicado for up to a year is a reason to seek divorce.</li>
<li>When the couples have separated and been living apart for a period of two years and none of them objects to the dissolution of marriage being granted by the court.</li>
<li>When both couples have separated and been living apart for a period of three years. If a divorce is predicated on this reason, the court has no other discretion to exercise than to grant the divorce. See the case of <strong><em>Omotunde v. Omotunde (2001) 9 NWLR (pt. 718) 525.</em></strong></li>
<li>When the other party has for a period of not less than a year failed to comply with the order of the court to resume cohabitation and restitution on the conjugal right (having sexual intercourse again).</li>
<li>When one of the couples has been missing for at least seven years, which is enough for him or her to be presumed to have been dead.</li>
</ul>
<p>When any of the reasons above is why a partner is seeking a divorce, it must be established that it leads to the primary ground which is that it made the marriage to have broken irretrievably.</p>
<p>Also, courts will be hesitant to grant partners divorce for a marriage that is less than two years, this is called the two years rule. The exception to this Two-Years Rule by virtue of section 30 (2) MCA applies as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>where the respondent has willfully and persistently refused to consummate the marriage;</li>
<li>that since the marriage the Respondent has committed adultery and the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent;</li>
<li>since the marriage, the respondent has committed rape, sodomy, or bestiality;</li>
<li>proceedings for a decree of dissolution of marriage by way of cross-proceedings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The law according to Section 30 of the Act provides that it is only with the leave (permission) of the court that a proceeding for divorce and separation of marriage that is less than two years can be commenced.</p>
<p>The Court will issue an order for a decree nisi if any or all of the foregoing are proven. A nisi order is a temporary order that separates the marriage. In the absence of any appeal by the affected party, the order automatically becomes absolute (i.e. permanent) after three (3) months. When the Court issues an absolute decree, the marriage is entirely dissolved.</p>
<p>Neither party has the right to challenge the High Court&#8217;s decision if the decree nisi has become absolute and one of the parties dies before the three (3) month period has passed.</p>
<p>However, a Petitioner in a suit for dissolution of marriage may not succeed in getting a divorce order if he/she has condoned any of the facts provided for under Section 15 (2) of the Act already discussed above.</p>
<p>The dissolution of a statutory marriage has the effect of allowing any of the parties to marry again. When a judge deems a marriage dissolved, the parties are legally free and single, as free as birds to mix and enter another marriage if they so desire.</p>
<p>In conclusion, every marriage is unique, and each has its own set of unique facts about which couples should seek legal advice and guidance while contemplating a dissolution of such a marriage.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nigerian system recognizes three types of marriages, which are statutory marriage; customary marriage; and Islamic marriage. Under the customary and Islamic marriages, the right to a woman to acquire and own property was subject to the consent and control of their husbands, as women are often regarded as subordinates to their husbands and as such not entitled to rights of any family property upon divorce. Upon dissolution of the marriage, she is often disposed of any properties or benefits. However, in a statutory marriage, there are benefits enjoyed by women married under the Marriage Act as they have rights in matters of divorce rights to property or inheritance. In proceedings for the dissolution of a legal marriage, the court exercises its discretion to ensure that family properties are divided equitably and fairly.</p>
<p><strong>The Marriage Act 1990</strong> and other legislation which will be outlined below, gives a wife married under the statutory law the rights to acquire, hold or dispose of and have shares in a family property in the event of divorce.</p>
<p>There are several laws and judicial precedents that support and guarantee the right of a legal wife to acquire family properties and inheritance in the event of a divorce in Nigeria. The major laws that protect the right of women to own properties in Nigeria are the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria (as amended), which abolished any form of discrimination against women and the Matrimonial Causes Act, which mandates the settlement of property in favour of women in deserving circumstances</p>
<p>In determining the rights of a legal wife in divorce proceedings, the court treats family properties owned by spouses as separate and it adopts a strict approach in determining the proprietary rights of a wife.  The court has the power to order the settlement of property for the benefit of parties to the divorce or children of the marriage using the equitable approach to ensure that the property is shared equitably and fairly. As by <strong>Section 25</strong> of the Matrimonial Causes Act, on the application of the Respondent made in course of divorce proceedings, the court may if it considers it just and proper in the circumstances of the case, makes provisions for the maintenance or benefit of the respondent.</p>
<p>Section 72 of the Act goes further to provide that <strong><em>“the court in divorce proceedings may require parties to the marriage, or either of them to make for the benefit of all or any of the parties and the children to the marriage, such a settlement of property to which the parties are, or either of them is entitled (whether in possession or reversion) as the court may consider just and equitable in the circumstances of the case”.</em></strong></p>
<p>In exercising its powers, the court may order that any necessary deed or instrument be executed and that the documents of title be produced or such other thing be done as necessary to enable an order to be carried out effectively or provide security for the performance of the order.</p>
<p>In the settlement of property during divorce proceedings, the financial contribution of the parties to the property is often the approach adopted by the court to determine the extent of rights to be granted in favour of the wife. The Nigerian courts often rely on documentary evidence as proof of the existence of joint ownership of property or financial contribution towards the acquisition of the property or development of the property before the claims to the right of property can succeed, especially where the legal title to the property is in the name of the husband.</p>
<p>This strict approach was applied in the case of <strong><em>ESSIEN vs. ESSIEN (2009) 9 NWLR (Pt.1146) 306, 331-332</em>&#8211;</strong> where the court insisted that direct financial contribution to the purchase of a matrimonial home or the repayment of the mortgage be proved before the joint property is inferred. The property in dispute was in the sole name of the respondent-husband. The appellant’s- wife petition for dissolution ran concurrently with the respondent’s suit. The divorce petition concluded earlier than that of the husband and it was declared that the parties were joint owners of the disputed property. The wife sought to introduce the judgement in her husband&#8217;s suit. She argued that her husband collected her salary as part of her contribution to the building and her father provided lodging for the parties whenever they were in the town where the building was located.</p>
<p>The trial court discounted the divorce judgment and held that the respondent was the sole owner of the property. The Court of Appeal also upheld the decision of the trial court and stated that the requirement for joint ownership can only be inferred where there is a direct financial contribution to the purchase price of the matrimonial home or the repayment of mortgage instalments. The same principle of law was approved by the court in the case of <strong><em>ADAKU AMADI vs. EDWARD NWOSU (1992) 6 SCNJ 59.</em></strong></p>
<p>However, flowing from the above-cited provision of the law, the court is required to adopt a just and equitable approach in determining the rights of a legal wife to family properties, whether or not there was a financial contribution to the purchase of the property, depending on the circumstances of the case brought before it, especially where it will result to an unfair result on a legal wife without title to the family property.</p>
<p>In deciding an equitable distribution in the settlement of family property in divorce proceedings, the courts have to exercise their discretionary powers depending on the facts of the case, and also consider the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>The time the property was acquired (it must have been acquired during the subsistence of the marriage or payment for it must have been concluded during the marriage).</li>
<li>Whether the property was acquired jointly.</li>
<li>The income and property of each spouse at the time of the marriage.</li>
<li>The contribution of the parties to the family property.</li>
<li>The conduct of parties to the divorce proceedings;</li>
<li>The age and position of the children.</li>
</ul>
<p>The court also in some instances can order a lump sum of money to be paid to the wife rather than a settlement of property to her. This was what happened in the case of <strong><em>SODIPE vs. SODIPE (1990) 5 WRN 98 </em></strong>where there was no evidence of a direct financial direction, the court however valued the matrimonial property to be worth N10 Million Naira and ordered the payment of N200,000 to the wife who had spent 43 years in the marriage.</p>
<p>In the case of<strong><em> MR. ALEXANDER IBEABUCHI vs. MRS. NNEKA IBEABUCHI (2016) LPELR- 41268,</em></strong> the trial court awarded the property at No.48, Sarki Yaki, Nomaonds Land Kano to the Respondent(wife) even where there was no evidence of contribution to the property, as it was just and equitable to do so. The court in reaching its decision relied on the provisions of Section 72 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, that settlement of property is based on what is just and equitable in the circumstance of the case. The court further held that in determining the rights of parties on what is just and equitable, the court has a wide discretionary power to exercise, and it is immaterial that another judge would have done it differently or would have considered a different arrangement to be just and equitable.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>OKERE vs. AKALUKA (2014) LPELR -24287 (CA) 1, 60-61</em></strong> the court held that it would be unconscionable to deprive a woman and her children of the right in a property to which she contributed substantially regarding its acquisition and development. The court was also of the view that the indirect contribution of wives to the matrimonial property should grant them a beneficial entitlement to the property on the basis that it was the performance of their functions as wives that enabled their husbands to perform theirs.</p>
<p>Finally, the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) which is the supreme legislation in Nigeria is built on the principle of equality and justice and guarantees the rights of any person to acquire properties in Nigeria as <strong>Section 42</strong> provides that “<strong><em>every citizen, whether male or female has the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of gender or religion amongst other things&#8230;.”.</em></strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, several laws in Nigeria, especially the Administration of Estate Law of each state has granted women the right to inherit the husband that dies without a will (intestacy). Under the Administration of Estate Law of Lagos, the legal wife is the first in line to inherit the property of a husband who died without a valid will.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joint ownership of property implies that there are two or more persons who contributed resources to purchase and own title to a landed property for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes as a way of resident or investment or jointly inherited or jointly gifted. The common situation of joint ownership of property is when married couples or family members are gifted or decide to purchase a property together.</p>
<p>Where joint ownership of property exists, it means that each party has an equal proprietary right of ownership on the land notwithstanding the weight of contribution made by each party and can jointly exercise such rights in respect of the property.</p>
<p>In the decided case of <strong><em>Sunday Obasohan Vs. Thomas Omorodion &amp; Anor (2001) 10 SC 85; (2001) LPELR-2154 (SC),</em></strong> the Supreme Court in confirming the decision of the trial court declared that the plaintiff and the defendants having succeeded their respective fathers following the Bini native law and custom were joint owners of all the piece of land with building situate thereon lying at Akpakpava Street Benin City.</p>
<p>In the cited case above, the appellant was the defendant in an action brought against him by the respondents in respect of the premises situated Akpakpava Street, Benin. The respondent claimed that the property was acquired by their several fathers who were brothers sometime in 1919 by a grant from one obazuaye. The case was that their fathers contributed money and built on the premises, on the completion of the building, they moved in and settled there. Thomas Omorodion, the first respondent claimed that his father, one of the three brothers lived in part of the house until he died in 1957. Whereon as his father’s oldest son he inherited the portion occupied by his father and was in possession until the appellant entered that portion and converted it into rooms and shops which he let out to tenants. The appellant’s case was that his father solely acquired the premises and built on them. He claimed that his father only allowed the respondent’s fathers to live there by virtue of their being brothers. He denied that the respondents were entitled to inherit any portion of the premises.</p>
<p>The matter was reported to the Oba of Benin who ruled that the house belonged to the three deceased brothers. The appellant did not yield to the warning and the 1st respondent filed an action at the High Court. Judgment was entered for the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent for damages for trespass. On appeal, the Court of Appeal confirmed the judgment of the trial court.</p>
<p><strong>The legal implication of a Joint Ownership of Property</strong></p>
<p>There are legal implications on the purchase, gift, or inheritance of joint property by two or more persons. These include;</p>
<ul>
<li>In joint ownership of property, there is a unity of possession, title, and interest in the property. This simply means that the joint owners can enjoy the use of the property together at the same time. Hence, no party can lay claims of ownership of a part of the property to the exclusion of other parties.</li>
<li>In joint ownership of property, where one party dies, the property is survived by the remaining owners. The consequence of this is that the rights in the property cannot pass to the children or beneficiaries of the deceased party.</li>
<li>Before the rights in a joint property can be alienated to another, the consent of all joint owners must be obtained. Where consent is not obtained, the title passed to the purchaser becomes defective.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of Joint Ownership</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of joint ownership practiced in Nigeria and these are;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Joint Tenancy</strong>&#8211; in joint tenancy, each tenant has equal rights in the joint property at the same time. In the property instrument, there are no words of severance or separation as there is a unity of title, interest, time, and possession. The effect of this is that a joint owner cannot alienate his interest in the property without the consent of other co-owners of the property. Also, where a joint owner dies, his proprietary interest in the property is survived by the remaining co-owners and not by his heirs.</li>
<li><strong>Tenancy-in-Common</strong>&#8211; while in tenancy-in-common, the property instrument of title bears words of severance, separation, or distribution of property. The tenants in the joint ownership have unequal rights of interest in the property. where a joint owner dies, the deceased interest in the property forms part of his estate and is administered by the laws applicable to Wills (if he died testate) or Administration of Estate Law (if he died intestate). Hence, the heirs of the deceased assume ownership of the deceased share of the property because the joint co-owners cannot survive the deceased interest in the property.</li>
</ul>
<p>Joint ownership of property can give rise to disputes that may lead to litigation action if not properly managed. However, to avoid disputes, a joint property owned by two or more parties can be severed, separated, or properly managed if the parties take steps to sever the joint ownership by way of partitioning upon acquisition of the property. Parties can agree to the partitioning of the property by engaging the services of a lawyer to execute a Deed of Partition with agreed limits, sharing the property between the joint owners to convert it to individual ownership of the land.</p>
<p>Where partitioning of the property will not be feasible, then terms for management, sharing, and final sale of the property be documented by a lawyer to avoid disputes. Where this is the arising situation, the lawyer can include in the management agreement a clause that would enable the beneficiaries or survivors of a deceased joint owner to acquire the property rights of the owner upon his death.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is important to reiterate that before a property jointly owned is purchased, the buyer must conduct legal due diligence to ensure that the consents of all owners have been obtained and also ensure that all joint owners attest to the sale by signing as vendors, because the absence of consent on the sale of the property by one joint owner renders it invalid. This is hinged on the principle of <strong><em>“nemo dat quod non habet”</em></strong> which means that “<strong>you cannot give what you don’t have”.</strong></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Deed of Assent is a document or instrument of the Executor or legal Administrator of an estate to transfer, pass over or vest a legal interest or title in a property of a deceased person to the named beneficiary in a Will or any other third party. It grants the beneficiary legal ownership over a gift that has been given by a Will. The <strong>Administration of Estate Laws </strong>of each State of the Federation govern and regulate the estates of a deceased person.</p>
<p>It is important to state that a will in itself cannot confer title or ownership on a beneficiary, it is just a legal document that expresses how the assets of a testator will be shared upon death. A deed of assent serves the purpose of conferring legal ownership of a gift in a will on the named beneficiaries or a third party by Executors or Administrators of an estate. Where a deed of assent has been duly executed in favour of the beneficiaries, a third party cannot subsequently lay claims to the properties that have been duly passed on to the intended beneficiaries.</p>
<p><strong>Effect of an Assent in Lagos State</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 40</strong> of the Administration of Estate Law of Lagos State provides for the effect of assent by the personal representative. It states that <strong><em>“a personal representative may assent to the vesting in any person who either by devise, bequest, devolution, appropriation or otherwise, may be entitled to, either beneficiary or as a trustee or personal representative, of any estate or interest in real estate to which the testator or interstate was entitled or over which he exercised a general power of appointment by his will and which devolved upon the personal representative”.</em></strong></p>
<p>From the above-cited section, it can be adduced that a beneficiary cannot lay claim to the share of an estate of a deceased until the Executors or Administrators give their assent in writing to the vesting of the property.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions of a valid Assent</strong></p>
<p>A deed of assent to the vesting of a legal estate must meet the following conditions before it can be valid. These conditions as provided in <strong>Section 40 (4)</strong> of the Administration of Estate Laws of Lagos State are as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>The assent must be in writing;</li>
<li>It must be duly signed by all personal representatives or executors;</li>
<li>The property in relation to which the assent is granted must be .certain and;</li>
<li>The beneficiary in whose favour it is given must be stated.</li>
</ul>
<p>An assent not in writing or not in favour of a named person shall not be effectual to pass a legal estate.</p>
<p><strong>Application for the Registration of a Deed of Assent</strong></p>
<p>Ordinarily, a deed of assent is not a registrable instrument because stamp duty is not paid on it, however, where the subject property vested to a beneficiary in a will concerns real property, it is to be registered at the appropriate land registry where the property is located to inform the state and the public that the ownership in the property has changed.</p>
<p>The Directorate of Land Registry, Lands Bureau of Lagos State, has provided a checklist of the requirement for its registration.  These requirements are as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>An application letter addressed to the Registrar of Titles requesting to register a deed of assent with a functional phone number and email address.</li>
<li>Two copies of the deed of assent, which must be dated, signed and each page initialled.</li>
<li>Passport photographs of all the administrator/executors to be attached to the deed.</li>
<li>The front cover of the deed must be signed and sealed by the solicitor who prepared the deed.</li>
<li>Spiral/bookbinding.</li>
<li>A certified true copy of the root of the title.</li>
<li>A certified true copy of the letter of administration/ Will.</li>
<li>A sworn affidavit deposed to by the administrators/executors attesting to the vesting.</li>
<li>Original for sighting and one copy of the valid means of identification of all the administrators/executors.</li>
<li>Payment receipts<strong><u>.</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>A Deed of Assent is so important in the devolution of the estate of the deceased. The title in a property cannot pass to the intended named beneficiary or any third party without a duly executed deed of assent, which must be signed by the Executors or Administrators to the Will. And as earlier stated, once it has fulfilled the conditions highlighted above, a third party cannot lay claims to the properties of the deceased already passed on to the beneficiaries.</p>
<p>It is important to state that an assent need not be by deed and if it is by a deed, it is not a registrable instrument as the stamp duty payment is not required on it. This is because an estate duty has already been paid before a grant of probate or letter of administration was issued to the executors or the administrators.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joint Tenancy and Tenancy in common are similar in respect to the fact that they are estates held by more than one owner. However, both concepts are different in every other aspect.</p>
<p>In Joint Tenancy, each tenant has equal shares in the same property with the same deed at the same time. There contain no words of severance. This is usually the case in properties purchased by married couples. Hence, the ingredients of a Joint Tenancy are;</p>
<ol>
<li>Unity of Title: the co-owners must have the same title to the property and the title must emanate from the same grantor.</li>
<li>Unity of Interest: each co-owner owns an equal share of the property;</li>
<li>Unity of Time: the co-owners must acquire the property at the same time.</li>
<li>Unity of Possession: each co-owners must have an equal right to possess the whole property</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, Tenants-in-Common arises where the property’s instrument of a title has words of severance or separation or distribution property. The tenants may have unequal shares and a different ownership interest in the property. Here, a person might own 25% of the property while another might own 75% of the property usually based on their contribution to the purchase of the property.</p>
<p>In Joint Tenancy, instances, where co-owners predeceases the other owners, the deceased owner&#8217;s share of the property devolves to the surviving co-owner of the property, and the deceased owner’s estate and heirs will receive absolutely nothing. Furthermore, no probate is required to transfer the property into the names of the surviving co-owners. This is known as <strong>RIGHT OF SURVIVORSHIP</strong> as enunciated in the case of <strong>Obasohan v. Omorodion (2001) LPELR-SC.131/1996 or (2001) 13 NWLR (Pt.729) 206.</strong></p>
<p>However, in Tenancy in Common, the deceased owner’s share of the property forms part of his estate and the law applicable to Wills (if he has one) or administration of estate law applies to it if he died intestate. Thus, a tenant in Common has no right of survivorship.</p>
<p>A Joint Tenancy continues as long as more than one Joint Tenant survives. Upon the death of one tenant, the shares of the other tenants increase equally as they automatically absorb the ownership interest of the deceased person.</p>
<p>Moreover, the presence of any of the following words in a Will creates a Tenancy-in-Common: “in equal shares”; “share and share alike”; “to be distributed between”; “to be distributed among them in joint and equal proportion”; “equally”; “among”; and “respectively”.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court held that by operation of law, joint tenancy leads to the doctrine of survivorship by which if one joint tenant dies without having obtained a separate share of the property for himself or herself, during his or her lifetime, his or her interest will not pass to his or her estate but such interest will accrue to the other surviving joint tenants. See <strong>Chinweze v. Mazi (1989) 1 SC (part 11) 33 at 46</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ways to Terminate Joint Tenancy</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>By an agreement with the co-tenants to convert the tenancy to a Tenancy in Common</li>
<li>By a transfer of shares to a third party (called the strawman) without the consent of the other tenants.</li>
<li>By Partition. This is the division of the property or shares in the property. It could be a physical division of the land or sale of the property and each co-tenant receives their share of the sale.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ways to terminate Tenancy in Common</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>By agreement between the co-tenants to sever the tenancy.</li>
<li>By partition by the co-owners or by an order of the court</li>
<li>By ouster, which means any act which unlawfully deprives a Tenant in Common of their share of the property?</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, it should be noted that there are limits to which properties can be owned and disposed of, the authority to sell a property between two persons depends on whether there is sole ownership, tenancy in common or the property is jointly owned. A co-owner cannot dispose of, partition or transfer a property solely owned by both of them without consent from the other owners of the property.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Annulment of Marriage in Nigeria </strong></p>
<p>There are various matrimonial reliefs available in the Matrimonial Causes Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act), 1978 for persons in a statutory marriage. One such is the annulment of marriage which in Section 114 of the Act is referred to as “Nullity of Marriage”. An application for nullity of marriage can be invoked where the marriage contracted by 2 persons is void or voidable. In this article, we will discuss what constitutes a void or voidable marriage, the grounds upon which each can be sought to be nullified, and how to commence an action in Court in that regard.</p>
<p>Before we proceed it is pertinent to note that although all marriages whether statutory, customary or Islamic are recognized in Nigeria as valid, for a statutory marriage to be considered valid in Nigeria, it must be conducted according to Section 21 of the Marriage Act at:</p>
<ul>
<li>a licensed place of worship for that purpose. This license is given by the Minister or the place of worship may have been previously licensed by another enactment whether or not it has been repealed.</li>
<li>By a recognized minister of the church, denomination or body to which such place of worship belongs</li>
<li>According to the rites or usages of marriage observed in such church, denomination or body.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>What is a Void and Voidable Marriage</em></strong></p>
<p>The holding of the Court in the case of <em><strong>De Reneville v. De Reneville (1948) All ER 56 </strong></em>by Lord Green which was also restated in the case of <strong>Mbonu v. Mbonu</strong> <strong>(1976) I FNR 57</strong> is apt in this circumstance. Therein it was clearly stated that:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;A void marriage is one that will be regarded by every court in any case in which the existence of the marriage is in issue as never having taken place and can be so treated by both parties to it without the necessity of any Decree annulling it;</em></p>
<p><em>A voidable marriage is one that will be regarded by every court as a valid subsisting marriage until a Decree annulling it has been pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, a void marriage is one that is invalid ab initio. From its inception, it never existed due to certain prior existing circumstances or failure to adhere to certain prescribed requirements while the marriage is being contracted. A voidable marriage on the other hand is valid for all intents and purposes but can be nullified by a party to the marriage due to the existence of certain circumstances such a party was not privy to at the time the marriage was contracted.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Grounds Upon Which A Petition for Decree of Nullity of Void Marriage can be Filed</strong></em></p>
<p>Section 3 of the Act provides that a marriage may be deemed void on any of the following grounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Existing Lawful Marriage:</strong> where either party to a statutory marriage is at the time of the marriage lawfully married (customarily or statutorily) to another person such marriage will be void. Therefore, where any lawful marriage precedes the present statutory marriage, the present one is void ab initio. This is further supported by section 33(1) of the Act which states that <strong><em>“</em>No marriage in Nigeria shall be valid where either of the parties thereto at the time of the celebration of such marriage is married by native law or custom to any person other than the person with whom such marriage is had.&#8221;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Section 35 of the Marriage Act further prohibits such and Section 39 states that any person who contracts such a marriage to another whom he/she knows to be married to another is liable to imprisonment for 5 (five) years.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prohibited Degrees of Consanguinity or Affinity:</strong> This refers to persons who are related by blood (consanguinity) or related through marriage (affinity). A marriage contracted by such persons is deemed void in Nigeria.</li>
</ul>
<p>The First Schedule to the Act in terms of prohibited degrees of consanguinity and affinity for a man include: his ancestress, descendant, sister, Maternal and Paternal aunt, Niece, Mother-in-Law, Wife’s Grandmother, Wife’s daughter, Wife’s son’s daughter, Wife’s Daughter’s daughter, Father’s wife, Grandfather’s wife, Son’s wife, Son’s son’s wife and daughter’s son’s wife. For a woman, it includes: her ancestor, descendant, brother, Maternal and Paternal Uncle, Nephew, Father-in-Law, Husband’s Grandfather, Husband’s son, Husband’s son’s son, Husband’s Daughter’s son, Mother’s husband, Grandmother’s husband, Daughter’s husband, Son’s daughter’s husband and daughter’s daughter’s wife</p>
<p>However, by section 4 of the Act such marriage is only void if the parties do not apply to a judge for permission to contract such a marriage and the judge consequently grants same having been satisfied that exceptional circumstances warrant the grant of the permission.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invalidity by The <em>Lex Loci Celebrationis</em>(Law Of The Place Of Celebration</strong>: A marriage is regarded as void where the parties fail to comply with the form prescribed by the law of the place where it was contracted as regards the solemnization of marriage.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had earlier stated that for a marriage to be valid in Nigeria it must comply with certain requirements set out in Section 21 of the Marriage Act. Section 33(2) of the Marriage Act 1914 further states that a marriage is void where both parties to a marriage knowingly and wilfully take part in marriage under any of the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>In any place other than the office of a registrar or a licensed place of worship</li>
<li>Without a special license granted by the Minister authorising such marriage between named persons by the registrar or a recognised minister of some religious denomination or body in accordance with Section 13 of the Marriage Act.</li>
<li>Celebration under false name(s)</li>
<li>Celebration without a Registrar’s Notice</li>
<li>Celebration by a person not being a recognised minister of a religious denomination or body or by a registrar of marriage.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is noteworthy, that it must be proved that both parties contracted the marriage in full knowledge of any of the circumstances mentioned above. Anyeagbunam v. Anyeagbunam (1973) 4 SC 121.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Consent</strong>: the marriage in this instance is void where either of the party’s “consent” was obtained on the basis of:</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Duress or fraud. Duress in the sense that the consent was obtained through compulsion or by creating a state of fear or apprehension in either of the parties and fraud where certain facts were misrepresented by a party to the marriage to obtain the consent of the other.</li>
<li>This occurs where a party is mistaken as to the identity of the other party or the nature of the marriage performed.</li>
<li>A marriage is void where consent was obtained from a party incapable of understanding the nature of the marriage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Marriageable Age</strong>: </em>A marriage is void where either of the parties contracted the marriage at an age not regarded as marriageable age by the law. Although the Act does not prescribe marriageable age, the Child Rights Act and the Child Rights Law of States state that an 18-year-old is an adult and thus of marriageable age.</li>
</ul>
<p>A marriage contracted under any of the grounds mentioned above is void ab initio, as it never existed, nor it is recognized by the law. A decree nullifying a non-existent marriage is thus not necessary. However, to clear any assumptions created by virtue of the parties’ relationship or actions that connote the existence of a marriage, a decree nullifying same may be obtained in that regard. Also, parties upon realizing any of the errors above that can be remedied by a subsequent valid marriage may proceed to do so.</p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Grounds Upon Which A Petition for Decree of Nullity of Voidable Marriage can be Filed</strong></em></p>
<p>A voidable marriage, unlike a void marriage, is valid and only becomes void at the instance of one of the parties to the marriage. The marriage is valid for all intents and purposes in the eyes of the law (having complied with the prescribed form and also was not contracted under any of the grounds that would render it void ab initio), until and unless a party to the marriage decides to render the same void.</p>
<p>A marriage is voidable at the instance of a party to a marriage on the basis of any of the conditions stated in section 5 of the Act:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incapacity to Consummate the Marriage</strong>: where either party to the marriage is incapable of consummating it, the marriage is voidable at the instance of the party capable of consummating the marriage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The incapacity to consummate must be ascertained. Sterility i.e. where the party cannot procreate does not amount to incapacity, neither does use of contraceptives or withdrawal method as held in the case of <em><strong>Baxter V. Baxter (1948) A.C.274.</strong></em>The incapacity to consummate must exist at of time of the marriage and during the hearing of the petition. Furthermore, Section 36 of the Act state that a decree of nullity cannot be made on this ground until the court is satisfied that at the time of hearing of the petition: the incapacity is not curable, the respondent refuses to submit for a medical examination to determine if it is curable and the respondent refuses to submit for proper treatment if the incapacity is curable.</p>
<p>Also, by section 35 of the Act, a party suffering from the incapacity to consummate cannot file a petition in this regard unless he/she is not aware of the incapacity at the time of the marriage. Section 36(2) of the Act also provides that the decree shall not be made by reason of the petitioner’s knowledge of the incapacity, the conduct of the petitioner, lapse of time, public interest, where it would be harsh and oppressive to the respondent or for any other reason.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy, that the party must be incapable of consummating the marriage and not wilfully and persistently refuse to do same which is a ground for the <a href="https://www.resolutionlawng.com/dissolution-of-statutory-marriage-in-nigeria/">dissolution of marriage</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unsoundness of Mind, Mental Disorder and Recurrent Attacks of Insanity or Epilepsy</strong><em>: </em>where either party suffers from any of this, a decree can be sought to nullify the marriage. The unsoundness of mind need not be absolute, it can also be weakness of understanding. Section 5(2) of the Act defines mentally defective as one owing to an arrested or incomplete development of mind due to inherent cause, induced by disease or injury which requires oversight thus making the party unfit for the responsibilities of marriage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Section 37 of the Act states that for a petitioner to file a petition under this ground, he/she must be ignorant of the fact at the time of the marriage, must have filed a petition for decree of nullity not later than 12 (twelve) months after the date of the marriage and sexual intercourse must not have occurred after discovering the above fact.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Venereal Disease</em>: </strong>A marriage is voidable where either party is suffering from a venereal disease in a communicable form. This ailment must have existed at the time of the marriage. Such diseases include HIV, Hepatitis B etc. The disease can be proved by calling medical evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Section 37 of the Act states that for a petitioner to file a petition under this ground, he/she must be ignorant of the fact at the time of the marriage, must have filed a petition for decree of nullity not later than 12 (twelve) months after the date of the marriage and sexual intercourse must not have occurred after discovering the above fact.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Wife’s Pregnancy for a Person other than the Husband:</strong> </em>The marriage is voidable at the instance of the husband where at the time of the marriage, the wife is pregnant for another man.</li>
</ul>
<p>By Section 37 of the Act, a petitioner can only file under this ground where he is ignorant of the fact at the time of the marriage. Also, the petition for a decree of nullity must be filed not later than 12 (twelve) months after the date of the marriage and sexual intercourse must not have occurred after discovering the above fact.</p>
<p>By section 38 of the Act, a decree of nullity of a voidable marriage has the effect of annulling the marriage from and including the date on which the decree becomes absolute, but it does not render illegitimate a child of the parties born since or legitimated during the marriage.</p>
<p>A petition for a decree of nullity of marriage is filed in accordance with Form 6 provided for in the Matrimonial Causes Rules, wherein details of the petitioner and respondent, their marriage, children, grounds for the petition are stated and any other evidence or witnesses that can be used to prove their existence. The action is commenced at any High Court of a State.</p>
<p>In conclusion, only statutory marriages (i.e. marriages contracted under the Marriage Act) are entitled to any of the matrimonial reliefs under the <a href="https://lawcarenigeria.com/matrimonial-causes-act/">Matrimonial Causes Act</a>. They must comply with the prescribed form provided thereof. Also, while an interested party may bring a petition for a decree of nullity of a void marriage upon the death of either party, in a voidable marriage such cannot be filed as it remained valid till the death, it does not divulge the surviving party of any rights.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To conduct a land verification in Abuja, an application for verification must be made to the appropriate authority or land registry.</p>
<p>In Abuja, the appropriate authority is the Abuja Geographic Information System (AGIS). A person intending to purchase land within the environs of the Federal Capital Territory must submit the following requirements at AGIS to conduct a search or verify the particulars of the land:</p>
<ol>
<li>An application letter addressed to the Director of Lands Administration providing full details of the property which is stated on the Certificate of Occupancy to wit: Name of Owner, File Number, Plot No(s), Certificate of Occupancy Number and date.</li>
<li>Evidence of payment of legal search fee either N10, 000 (residential purposes) or N20, 000 (commercial purposes). The customized teller for such is available in the Bank.</li>
<li>Original Certificate or Right of Occupancy for sighting.</li>
<li>Photocopy of valid means of identification.</li>
</ol>
<p>The search is carried out by the staff at the Land Registry who prepare a search report stating whether the details provided in the letter match that of the document with them or of any land registered there.</p>
<p>Apart from carrying out a search at AGIS, it is advisable to carry out a search at the following places based on the circumstances surrounding the land to be purchased:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Probate Registry</strong>&#8211; to determine the authority of the persons disposing off the deceased’s property. This registry is attached to the Court and for Abuja, it can be accessed at the High Court in Maitama.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Affairs Commission</strong>&#8211; where the property belongs to a company. This is to determine if there are any registered charges on the assets of the company. It also aids in determining whether the seller is a person who has the authority to act on behalf of the company and conduct transactions in its name and determines whether the property has been mortgaged.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lawyer who is an accredited agent with the Corporate Affairs Commission can conduct this search.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is pertinent to conduct a search on land to verify that the title intended to be purchased belongs to the person or entity posing as the owner. The search also helps to unravel whether there are any encumbrances on the said land. Engaging the services of a professional makes this process hassle-free and ensures an efficient and thorough search to avoid problems that may arise in the future questioning the title.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Any person who has been served with a divorce in Nigeria may respond to the Petition by filing an answer in a prescribed form.  First of all, it is essential for filing purposes to state that a person who institutes a divorce petition for dissolution of marriage because the marriage has broken down irretrievably is called a <strong>Petitioner</strong>, while the other spouse against whom it is filed against is called a <strong>Respondent.</strong></p>



<p>A Divorce Petition is filed at any State High Court in Nigeria where a statutory marriage conducted between two people has broken down irretrievably. In our previous write-up, we explained the procedure for instituting a divorce petition in Nigeria.</p>



<p>The ground for instituting the action for divorce must conform with Section 15 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1970. The Petitioner, through a legal practitioner who prepared the Petition, ensures that the Petition filed is duly served on the Respondent as provided under <strong>Order III, Part 2 of the Matrimonial Causes Rules</strong> which states that;</p>



<p><strong><em>“&#8230;.when an application to a Court has been filed, the applicant shall cause service of the application to be effected on each other party to the application.”</em></strong></p>



<p>The purpose of ensuring service of the divorce petition filed is to allow the Respondent to exercise his or her rights by responding to the Petition by filing an answer or Cross-Petition where he also wants to divorce his or her spouse on reasons other than what is alleged in the Petition.</p>



<p>The Respondent exercises the process of responding to a Divorce Petition by filing a written Answer to the Petition filed. The Respondent usually files the Answer through his legal practitioner. An Answer to a Petition filed is the act of acknowledging receipt of the dissolution of marriage, challenging information raised about him or her in the wedding, and also to deny any false allegations or facts raised in the Petition. The Respondent’s Answer filed should also state his or her position on the other reliefs sought in court, such as child custody (where there is a child involved), maintenance and settlement of property, or any other reliefs sought by the Petitioner in the divorce Petition</p>



<p>According to <strong>Order VII of the Matrimonial Causes Rules</strong>, the Respondent or a co-Respondent in proceedings instituted by Petition or a person named in a petition may by filing an answer:</p>



<ol type="a">
<li><strong><em>deny a fact alleged in the Petition;</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>state that he does not know and cannot admit the truth of a fact alleged in a Petition;</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>allege a fact; or</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>admit the truth of a fact, being a fact material to the proceedings instituted by Petition, or a person named is a party or in which he is entitled to intervene.</em></strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Also, where the Respondent or co-respondent in a proceeding instituted by Petition or a person named in a petition desires to submit to the Court that it should dismiss the divorce proceedings; he shall in an Answer filed for the purpose, asking the Court to dismiss the proceedings.</p>



<p>A Respondent who desires to challenge the jurisdiction of the Court to which the Petition is addressed can also file an Answer Under Protest objecting and stating the grounds upon which he or she objects to the jurisdiction of the Court.</p>



<p>An Answer filed shall be filed by the Respondent within the time limited by the Notice of Petition addressed to the party filing an Answer. The time specified to file an Answer to a Petition is 28 days.</p>



<p>Where a divorce petition has been duly filed and served on the Respondent by the Petitioner, the Respondent, who fails to respond to the Petition will be likely presumed to agree with the divorce and other reliefs sought in it. The Court, in its powers, will grant sufficient time to the Petitioner to ensure that the Respondent is appropriately served with the divorce petition and all other processes involved in the dissolution of marriage. Where the Respondent still refuses to acknowledge the Petition by filing an Answer, then the Court will dissolve the marriage after the necessary proceedings are concluded.</p>



<p>Where a Respondent wants a divorce after a Petition has been served on him or her, he or she can also file an Answer with a Cross-Petition on the same document. The Answer and Cross-Petition also state the reliefs sought by the Respondent, such as joint custody or sole custody of the child (ren) of the marriage, maintenance, or property sharing, if any.</p>



<p>Once the Respondent has filed and served the Answer and Cross-Petition, the Court will then determine the status of the marriage while relying on the Petition filed by the Petitioner, and the Answer/or Answer and Cross-Petition filed by the Respondent.</p>



<p>In closing, the Respondent must file an Answer to any divorce petition within 28 days if he or she wants the Court to take into account his or her part of the story before making a final decision in respect of the Petition. Filing this type of Answer is very crucial where the Respondent seeks to deny some of the facts stated in the Petition or pursue any other reliefs for himself or herself. Where the Respondent fails to respond to a divorce Petition after fully served with the copy of the Petition, such a Respondent shall be deemed to have accepted all the facts contained in the Petition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO VERIFY MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>The Marriage Act under the provision of <strong>Section 30(1)</strong> states that <strong><em>“every Registrar of Marriage is obliged to keep in his office a Marriage Register Book in which every certificate of marriage is filed in his office shall be registered”. </em></strong>This means that the Registrar or a clergyman whose church has been duly licensed by the Federal Government to perform wedding services under the Act is charged with the responsibility of keeping records and copy of every marriage certificate of statutory marriages conducted.</p>
<p>Verification of a marriage certificate in Nigeria is simply the process of investigating the authenticity of claims made by individuals of their marital status. There has been a rising need to verify marriage certificates presented for various reasons such as the alarming rate of forgery of such document, the need to submit such document during a visa application or to collect benefits.</p>
<p>A Marriage Certificate is an official document that evidences that a statutory marriage was conducted between two people and like any other valid certificate, it can be verified to confirm its authenticity to the party seeking such a verification.</p>
<p><strong>Who can verify a Marriage Certificate?</strong></p>
<p>The interested participants in the verification of a marriage certificate procedure can be either of the following parties;</p>
<ul>
<li>The applicant’s i.e. the married couple, either the husband or wife.</li>
<li>The authorities of a foreign country or embassy.</li>
<li>Nigerian authorities or institutions that establish the authenticity of the claims from available records.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to verify a marriage certificate</strong></p>
<p>To verify a marriage certificate in Nigeria, one may employ the services of a legal practitioner to investigate the veracity of the claims of marriage or do it himself or herself.  The legal practitioner investigating must visit the place where the marriage certificate was issued and conduct a search on the marriage register kept there, upon that process the marriage certificate may be confirmed and certified as authentic by the issuing authority. It may be declared as a fake if the designated registry does not possess such a record of marriage.</p>
<p>A Marriage Certificate is issued by a government official of the federal marriage registry or local government registry after a statutory marriage has been conducted. The certificate can also be issued by a licensed place of worship.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements to verify a marriage certificate</strong></p>
<p>The only requirement to verify a marriage certificate is the copy of the certificate itself.</p>
<p>If the party seeking such a verification does not have the copy of the marriage certificate, the person must provide details such names of the parties to the marriage; date of the marriage and the marriage registry.</p>
<p>Finally, the best place to verify the authenticity of a marriage is the marriage registry where such a marriage is conducted. However, the Federal Government is also working to harmonize all marriage registries in order to list all marriages conducted in Nigeria to single database for easy verification. Howbeit, the official document that can evidence such a verification, which is the Certified True Copy (CTC) of the marriage can only be collected at the registry where the marriage was conducted or recorded.</p>

<p>The procedure for how to verify a Nigerian divorce certificate commences by obtaining a copy of a particular divorce certificate to be verified. To verify divorce status in Nigeria, the applicant or its attorney must personally visit the appropriate court registry where the certificate was issued.</p>



<p>Upon the successful completion of divorce proceedings in Nigeria, the Judge would issue an order of <em>decree nisi, </em>usually through a full judgment of the court dissolving the marriage. The decree nisi would usually become absolute after three months. The decree absolute permanently dissolving the marriage, becomes the final divorce certificate.</p>



<p><strong>STEPS TO VERIFY DIVORCE CERTIFICATE</strong></p>



<p>A person who wants to verify the genuineness of his divorce certificate can either employ the services of a solicitor to carry out the verification or can conduct the verification personally.</p>



<p>The principal legislation governing divorce proceedings in Nigeria is the <a href="https://lawcarenigeria.com/matrimonial-causes-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matrimonial Causes Act.</a> The Act provides that a divorce petition in respect of marriage conducted in accordance with the Act can only be instituted in the High Court of a state in Nigeria.</p>



<p>Essentially, the following steps must be followed to verify a divorce certificate in Nigeria:</p>



<ol type="1">
<li>The decree absolute together with or without the decree nisi should be taken to the registry of the State High Court where the marriage was dissolved and where the order was issued.</li>
<li>The application to search will be made at the court registry, to confirm the genuineness of the divorce documents.</li>
<li>Requisite fees as prescribed at the court’s registry will as well be paid. If a solicitor is hired, the applicant will also pay the solicitor’s professional fees.</li>
<li>Upon confirmation of the genuineness of the divorce certificate, an application may be made for a certified true copy of the decree absolute and the decree nisi evidencing the genuineness of the decree.</li>
</ol>



<p>As earlier stated, a person can either conduct the above-stated steps personally or employ the services of a <a href="https://www.resolutionlawng.com/lawyers/olusola-jegede-mciarb/">Nigerian attorney</a>. It is however best advised that a person should employ the services of a solicitor to carry out the verification to avoid hiccups.</p>



<p>Finally, it is worthy of mention that a Nigerian divorce certificate cannot be verified online. There is no database to verify all divorces in Nigeria. A person or an institution seeking to verify a divorce certificate issued in any Nigerian court must personally apply at the registry of the court or hire a solicitor to do so on its behalf.</p>
