										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO RENOUNCE A NIGERIAN CITIZENSHIP</strong></p>
<p>A citizen is a person who, by place of birth, nationality of one or both parents, or naturalization is granted full rights and responsibilities as a member of a nation or political community, Citizenship is a relationship between an individual and a state to which the individual owes allegiance and in turn is entitled to its protection. Each state determines the conditions under which it will recognize persons as its citizens, and the conditions under which that status will be withdrawn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSIBILITIES OF A CITIZEN</strong></p>
<p>With reference to chapter 11 section 24 of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the responsibilities of the citizens are spelt out as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respect for the ideals of the constitution/institutions.</li>
<li>Respect for National Flag; National Pledge and Legitimate Authority.</li>
<li>Enhance the power, prestige and good name of Nigeria.</li>
<li>Respect the dignity of other citizens and their rights.</li>
<li>Promote the spirit of common brotherhood and good neighbourliness.</li>
<li>Make positive and useful contributions to the advancement, progress and wellbeing of the community of residence.</li>
<li>Render assistance to appropriate agencies in the maintenance of law and order. i.e reporting of criminal elements in the society.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RENOUNCING OF NIGERIAN CITIZENSHIP</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>29 (1) 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria provides as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>“<em>Any citizen of Nigeria of full age who wishes to renounce his Nigerian citizenship shall make a declaration in the prescribed manner for the renunciation”</em></strong></p>
<p>From the above provision of the constitution, one can evidently say that renunciation is a voluntary act of relinquishing one’s citizenship or nationality for another</p>
<p>In Nigeria, despite the fact that <strong>S. 28</strong> of the 1999 constitution allows for dual citizenship, on the other hand, it has also limited the same by making a person forfeit his citizenship where it appears that such person is not a citizen by birth and he later acquires or retains the citizenship or nationality of another country other than Nigeria.</p>
<p><strong>ELIGIBILITY </strong></p>
<ul>
<li> The person must be aged 18 years and above (the exception to a married woman below age 18 (<strong>S. 29 (4)(b)</strong>)</li>
<li> The person must be of a sound mind</li>
<li>The person must have acquired or would likely be granted citizenship in another country</li>
<li>The person has no criminal or financial liability to the state</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE PROCEDURE FOR RENUNCIATION OF CITIZENSHIP IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Visit the appropriate authority i.e. the Ministry of the interior, Nigerian immigration service or the Nigerian embassy in the country where the person resides.</li>
<li>Fill out the application form with complete information which must be signed and certified before a Magistrate or Notary public or Justice of Peace or Commissioner of oath.</li>
<li>Submit the application form(s) with the following documents:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Copy of the foreign passport</li>
<li>Copy of the foreign citizenship certificate or copy of confirmation that the applicant will become a citizen of a foreign country<br />
Birth certificate</li>
<li>Citizenship certificate (if any)</li>
<li>National Identity card (if any)</li>
<li>Passport-sized photograph of the applicant</li>
<li>Nigerian passport or other travelling documents</li>
<li>Marriage document (for female applicant below age 18)</li>
<li>Proof of acquisition of citizenship in another country</li>
</ul>
<p>Its worthy of note that the president reserves the power to withhold the registration of any declaration and renunciation of citizenship during war in which Nigeria is physically involved and where it is in his opinion that such declaration will be contrary to public policy. <strong>See S. 29 (3) (a) (b)</strong> of the 1999 constitution.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Renouncing citizenship is quite sensitive and should be properly thought over by the person contemplating it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SIS APPROVAL FOR FOR FOREIGN SPOUSE OF A NIGERIA WIFE</strong></p>
<p>Special Immigrant Status(SIS) is the approval given to foreigners that are married to Nigerian Women for the purpose of residing in Nigeria. A Foreigner married to a Nigerian woman is entitled to a Special Immigrant Status in Nigeria whereby such a foreigner can be eligible for Combined Expatriate Residence Permit Aliens Card (CERPAC), Nigerian Residence Permit, absolutely free of charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The application for an SIS is made to the Federal Ministry of Interior. The requirements for filing an application for SIS are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A formal letter of request from the Nigerian wife accepting Immigration Responsibility.</li>
<li>Formal letter of request from the husband.</li>
<li>Photocopies of the first five (5) pages of the wife’s Nigeria Standard passport.</li>
<li>Photocopy of Marriage Certificate.</li>
<li>Duly completed form IMM22 in triplicate copies with three (3) recent passport photographs.</li>
<li>Applicant’s National Passport.</li>
<li>Current Tax Clearance for the husband</li>
<li>Husband’s current resident permit.</li>
</ol>
<p>An Applicant for SIS must have obtained a Subject to Regularisation (STR) Visa to make him eligible to enter into the country before applying for the SIS. If the applicant is already a lawful resident in Nigeria through other means, he must provide proof of his residency.</p>
<p>Upon submission of the application, the application is forwarded to the Ministry of Home Affairs in the State of Residence of the Applicant for further investigation.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Home Affairs is charged with the responsibility of interviewing the Applicant, investigating and gathering pertinent information as to the true status and circumstances of the applicant. The Ministry of Home Affairs upon completion of its due diligence makes its recommendation to the Federal Ministry of Interior in respect of its findings. The Department of State Service (DSS) may also be enlisted to vet the Applicant at the Direction of the Federal Ministry of Interior.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that where an applicant arrived in Nigeria with an intention to process an SIS and such an STR visa has expired before the approval of the SIS, the applicant may be permitted to continue to reside in the country after the expiration of the STR Visa subject to the directive or discretion of the Nigerian Immigration Service since the STR Visa may not be renewed within Nigeria.</p>
<p>Upon approval, the holder of a special immigrant status is entitled to apply for and obtain CERPAC which is gratis, i.e. free of charge. The application shall be submitted to the Office of the Comptroller General, Nigeria Immigration Service Headquarters Abuja or to the Office of the Comptroller of Immigration Service at the State Commands where the expatriate is resident through the Nigerian spouse. The requirements to obtain CERPAC upon the grant of an SIS are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Letter of Application for Residence Permit by the Nigerian spouse accepting Immigration Responsibility</li>
<li>Copy of Special Immigrant Status approval letter by the Minister of Interior</li>
<li>Husband’s consent letter requesting for Special Immigrant Status</li>
<li>Nigerian passport bio-data page of the spouse</li>
<li>Copy of passport bio-data page of the spouse</li>
<li>Marriage Certificate</li>
<li>CERPAC Form</li>
<li>Two recent passport photographs</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, it takes an average of one year or more to obtain the SIS from the date of application to the Federal Ministry of Interior. The application for SIS must be accompanied with the prescribed fee. To qualify for SIS, the applicant must have been married to a Nigerian woman for up to 5 years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NIGERIAN WORK PERMIT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The current laws guiding immigration processes in Nigeria are the Immigration Act 2015 and the Immigration Regulations 2017 that was issued by the Honorable Minister of Interior in 2017. The immigration laws together with Nigeria Immigration Guidelines provide for the procedure and requirements for obtaining the Nigerian Resident permit. Work permit in Nigeria is only issued within the Nigeria territory upon the arrival of an expatriate or foreigner in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Essentially, the major method for acquisition of a Nigeria Work Permit is by employment by a Nigerian Company. The company seeking to employ a foreign employee must have acquired the Expatriate Quota on behalf of such employee. Another method of obtaining a Nigeria work permit, otherwise known as CERPAC (Combined Expatriate Residence Permit and Aliens Card) is by a marriage to a Nigerian male citizen. Any woman who is married to a Nigerian man is entitled to a special CERPAC known as a Niger-Wife.</p>
<p>Upon the obtainment of Expatriate Quota, a foreigner seeking to come to Nigeria must obtain a Subject To Regularization(STR) Visa.</p>
<p><strong>SUBJECT TO REGULARISATION VISA</strong></p>
<p>Subject to Regularization is issued primarily based on the availability of expatriate quota, especially in the case of private organizations. STRs are issued on request by sponsoring organizations and individual investors coming to Nigeria to reside. It is required by foreigners coming to take up employment in Nigeria. It usually allows for one single entry to foreign nationals who have the intention to obtain a long-term work permit upon arrival in Nigeria.</p>
<p>However, an STR Visa in itself is not a work permit. It is usually granted for 90 days within which an application must be made to regularize the recipient’s stay. Failure to do this will cause for reapplication of another STR visa.</p>
<p>Foreign nationals who generally are eligible to obtain the STR visa include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreign students</li>
<li>Research fellows</li>
<li>Government officials and their dependents</li>
<li>Missionaries, Clerics and their dependants</li>
<li>The foreign national staff of Non-Governmental Organisations(NGOs) and their dependants</li>
<li>Foreign nationals employed by companies operating in Nigeria and their dependants.</li>
</ul>
<p>The major documents required for the application of an STR visa include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passport with at least 6 months validity</li>
<li>Completed visa form in quadruplicate with four recent passport photographs</li>
<li>Copies of the letter of Expatriate Quota Approval from Ministry of Interior</li>
<li>Copies of credentials, certificates and curriculum vitae, all vetted by a relevant official of Nigerian High Commission/Embassy (English Certified translated copy where applicable)</li>
<li>Copies of offer Letter of Employment</li>
<li>Four copies of Letter of Acceptance of employment, signed by expatriate</li>
<li>Nigeria Immigration Service Visa Payment Receipt and Visa Acknowledge</li>
<li>Copy of university/ professional qualification</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>   NIGERIAN RESIDENT/WORK PERMIT (CERPAC)</strong></p>
<p>A Nigerian work permit is a document or card required allowing a foreign holder to reside in the country within a fixed or indefinite length of time. In Nigeria, the Comptroller General of Immigration is empowered to issue a Nigerian residence permit under the Federal Ministry of Interior’s supervision. The Nigerian resident/work permit is official known or called the Combined Expatriate Residence Permit and Aliens Card (CERPAC).</p>
<p>The CERPAC grants a foreigner permission to live and work in Nigeria for up to two years, which is subject to the renewal and validity of the expatriate quota.</p>
<p>An application for the CERPAC Nigeria should be accompanied by the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>International passport with STR visa endorsement</li>
<li>A duly completed CERPAC statutory form</li>
<li>An STR package containing STR documentation received from the Nigerian embassy/consulate</li>
<li>Company’s board of directors’ resolution confirming the appointment as director (where applicable)</li>
<li>Application letter from the employer requesting Regularization of stay and accepting Immigration       Responsibility (IR) on behalf of the expatriate.</li>
<li>Payment of prescribed fees</li>
</ul>
<p>By virtue of Section 18(2) of the Immigration Act 2015, a foreign national granted a residence permit does not require an entry visa. The section provides thus &#8220;<strong>A resident or work permit granted to a foreign Immigrant shall be<br />
treated for purposes of entry into Nigeria as a multiple entry permit&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>The Nigerian residence permit (CERPAC) is renewable every two years.</p>
<p><strong>     ECOWAS RESIDENCE CARDS</strong></p>
<p>The ECOWAS Treaty of Lagos 1975 provides for the free movement of citizens of ECOWAS member states within other member states. Member states of the Economic Community of West African States include the following countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benin</li>
<li>Burkina Faso</li>
<li>Cape Verde</li>
<li>Cote d’Ivoire</li>
<li>Gambia</li>
<li>Ghana</li>
<li>Guinea</li>
<li>Guinea Bissau</li>
<li>Liberia</li>
<li>Mali</li>
<li>Niger</li>
<li>Nigeria</li>
<li>Senegal</li>
<li>Sierra Leone</li>
<li>Equatorial Guinea</li>
<li>Togo</li>
</ul>
<p>The implication of this Treaty is that no citizen of any member state is required to obtain a visa from any other member state to cross such state’s border. However, for the purpose of residency, an ECOWAS Residence Card would be required by any ECOWAS nationals seeking to reside in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The following are the requirements for the grant of Expatriate Quota</p>
<ul>
<li>Application letter requesting the issuance of an ECOWAS Residence Card.</li>
<li>ECOWAS Travel Certificate or International Passport valid for 6months</li>
<li>Photocopy of bio-data page of ECOWAS Travel Certificate or National Passport</li>
<li>Two copies of the applicant’s recent passport photograph</li>
<li>Evidence of online payment</li>
<li>Duly completed and signed application form</li>
</ul>
<p>For citizens taking up employment, the following documents in addition to the above are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Letter of employment</li>
<li>Letter of acceptance of the offer of employment</li>
<li>Copies of professional/ educational certificates</li>
<li>Copy of CV</li>
<li>Evidence of registration with professional bodies (where application)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NIGERIAN SPOUSE VISA (NIGER WIFE)</strong></p>
<p>Foreign spouses of Nigerians are eligible to a resident permit. The Nigerian spouse visa is the type of permit classified as s Niger- wife. The application for a Nigerian spouse visa must be made to the Comptroller General of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Abuja or the Comptroller of Immigration Service at various state commands.</p>
<p>The Nigerian Immigration Service stipulates the following requirements for the processing of the spousal visa in Nigeria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Letter of Application for Residence Permit by the Nigerian spouse accepting Immigration Responsibility</li>
<li>Copy of Special Immigrant Status approval letter by the Minister of Interior</li>
<li>Husband’s consent letter requesting for Special Immigrant Status/letter of consent from Niger-wife stating willingness to stay with husband in Nigeria.</li>
<li>Nigerian passport bio-data page of the spouse</li>
<li>Copy of passport bio-data page of the spouse</li>
<li>Marriage Certificate</li>
<li>Completed CERPAC Form</li>
<li>Two (2) recent Passport photographs</li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from the processing fee that may be charged by any professional helping to process the application, the Niger-wife visa is Gratis i.e. government do not charge for its issuance.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Immigration Act, as well as Immigration Regulations, lay down the necessary requirements for the immigration processes for foreigners who wish to reside and work in Nigeria. Nigerian Immigration Service enforces Nigerian permits among other visas and is very strict about such enforcement. Consequently, an illegal immigrant or anyone who breach or break the Nigerian immigration laws may be liable for immediate removal from the country.</p>
