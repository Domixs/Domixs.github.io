										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LITHIUM LICENSE IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>Lithium mining is a growing industry in Nigeria, and the government has recently issued permits to allow companies to begin mining operations. The Nigerian government has identified lithium as a strategic mineral and is keen to develop the industry in order to benefit from its potential economic benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exploration for Lithium in Nigeria</strong></p>
<p>Exploration for lithium in Nigeria is still in the early stages. The Nigerian Geological Survey Agency (NGSA) is the government agency responsible for mineral exploration and mapping in the country. The NGSA has conducted several surveys in the Jos Plateau and has identified areas that are likely to contain lithium.</p>
<p>In 2018, a Nigerian mining company, Kian Smith Trade &amp; Co, announced that it had discovered lithium in commercial quantities in the country. The company stated that it had found 15,000 tonnes of lithium ore in the central part of Nigeria. This discovery has raised interest in lithium exploration in Nigeria and has attracted the attention of international mining companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types of Permits/Licenses for Lithium in Nigeria</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mining Permit:</strong> The Nigerian government has issued Small Scale Mining Leases to a few companies to begin lithium mining operations in the country. These permits are issued by the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development and are valid for a period of five years. The permits allow companies to explore and develop lithium deposits, as well as to extract and process the mineral.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Possess &amp; Purchase License</strong>: Possess &amp; Purchase License is issued to companies that are not willing to commence the mining process immediately, but rather purchase from mining companies, either for processing or immediate export. The Possess &amp; Purchase License is also issued by the Ministry of Mines Steel Development. It is renewable annually. Some of the key requirements to obtain this license include CAC Incorporation Documents; a Tax Clearance Certificate; an Attestation of Non-conviction from a Legal Practitioner; a Bank Reference Letter; Consent of a Mining Permit Holder among others.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mineral Buying Center</strong>: Mineral Buying Centre License is also similar to that of Possess &amp; Purchase License, save for it includes additional requirements such as Warehouse and Environmental Impact Assessment Report. The License permits a company to buy and store lithium in a particular location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mineral EXport Permit</strong>: The mineral Export Permit is in favour of a company ready to export minerals out of Nigeria. For a company to be eligible for this permit, such a company must have lithium that has been acquired or prepared for export and royalties must have been paid to the government on such minerals. The Export Permit is issued only on available minerals and it is issued by the same Ministry of Mines and Steel Development. A mineral Export Permit is a key requirement to export lithium out of Nigeria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nigerian government has also in place a number of regulations to ensure that the mining operations are conducted in a safe and responsible manner. These regulations include environmental protection measures, such as the requirement for companies to conduct environmental impact assessments before beginning operations. Companies must also adhere to safety standards and must ensure that their operations do not cause any harm to the environment or local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, the Nigerian government has also put in place a number of incentives to encourage companies to invest in the lithium mining industry. These incentives include tax breaks and other forms of support.</p>
<p>It is important to further emphasis that any foreign company seeking to engage in mining or buying of lithium or other mineral resources in Nigeria must first incorporate a local company in Nigeria. Under the Nigerian company law, every foreigner seeking to engage in business activities in Nigeria must incorporate a local entity; a foreign company is prohibited from engaging in any business activities in Nigeria without registering locally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Finally, the Nigerian government is committed to developing the lithium mining industry in the country and is keen to ensure that the industry is conducted in a safe and responsible manner. The issuance of permits to companies to begin mining operations or trading of lithium is an important step in this process and is likely to lead to increased investment in the industry.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Business Permits and other necessary licenses must be obtained by any foreign-owned company for a seamless business operation in Nigeria. In addition to obtaining a business permit, any foreigner wishing to work as an employee or control a company in Nigeria must also obtain an Expatriate Quota through the company for that purpose.</p>
<p>Both the Business Permit and Expatriate Quota are issued by the Federal Ministry of Interiors with the aims and objectives of regulating foreign investments and migrations into Nigeria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS PERMIT </strong></p>
<p>A business Permit is a document that allows foreigners to conduct business in Nigeria. It is usually issued by the Federal Ministry of Interior on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria. If a company is wholly owned by a foreigner(s), the business permit must be obtained from the ministry before the company commences business operation.</p>
<p><strong>Section 36(1)(a) and (b) of the Immigration Act (2015),</strong> and <strong>Paragraph 4 of the Immigration Regulations (2017) </strong>provides that no person other than a Nigerian citizen shall, on his own account or in partnership with any other person, practice a profession or establish or take over any trade or business whatsoever or register or take over any company with limited liability for any purpose without the written consent of the Minister of Internal Affairs”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EXPATRIATE QUOTA</strong></p>
<p>Expatriate Quota is a document that allows foreigners to work and live in Nigeria freely. The Expatriate Quota is processed by a company looking to hire foreigners to work and live in Nigeria. The expatriate quota is also applicable to any foreigner who is a director or an owner of a registered business in Nigeria and is willing to obtain residency status in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Expatriate quota is also issued by the Federal Ministry of Interior on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria.</p>
<p>The Federal Ministry of the Interior currently allocates a three-year quota for expatriates. A renewal application can be submitted after the quota has expired.</p>
<p>After a successful application for Expatriate Quota, the company can proceed to process a Subject to Regularization (STR) Visa for its expatriates. This will give the foreigner the opportunity to process and obtain the Combined Expatriate Residence Permit and Aliens Card (CERPAC) that allows them to live and work in Nigeria.</p>
<p><strong>Section 36(1)(a) and (b) of the Immigration Act, 2015</strong> provides that a foreigner granted a business permit must be able to fit into the Expatriate Quota.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING A BUSINESS PERMIT IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>The requirements for obtaining a business permit in Nigeria include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The certificate of incorporation of the applicant’s company</li>
<li>Tax Clearance Certificate</li>
<li>Memorandum and Articles of Association</li>
<li>The CAC Application status</li>
<li>The shareholding of the company.</li>
<li>Joint venture agreement</li>
<li>Approval from all appropriate professional bodies. This approval depends on the type of business being carried out by the company.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING AN EXPATRIATE QUOTA IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>The requirements for the grant of an expatriate quota include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duly completed registration form</li>
<li>Incorporation documents, which include a Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles of Association, Application Status including the particulars of the directors of the company</li>
<li>Feasibility report to be registered with CAC</li>
<li>Certified current audited account and bank reference letter</li>
<li>Annual income tax clearance certificate of each expatriate staff</li>
<li>Proposed annual salary to be paid to the expatriate worker indicating their designation, names, and duration of employment</li>
<li>Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) for partnership ventures between Nigerians and foreigners</li>
<li>Company’s Tax Clearance Certificate</li>
<li>Lease agreement or C of O for operating premises</li>
<li>Particular of training programs for Nigerians</li>
<li>List of Nigerians working in the company to understudy the expatriates</li>
<li>License permit from government agencies where the company engage in specialized sectors such as the oil and gas sector, telecommunications, health, etc</li>
<li>Certificate of capital importation where Applicant wants to import capital into the country</li>
<li>Business Permit</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, the approval of the grant of Expatriate Quota has been simplified so as not to overburden investors who are willing to come to invest in Nigeria. The government has ensured that foreign directors or owners of businesses can obtain expatriate quotas easily. In practice, foreign-owned companies often process business permits together with expatriate quotas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most times individuals in Nigeria or even outside of Nigeria may need to obtain a police character certificate for different reasons or purposes. However, the most common reason for obtaining a police character certificate is for immigration or travel purpose. In this article, we would briefly discuss the Police Character Certificate in Nigeria and the procedures for obtaining the same.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS A POLICE CHARACTER CERTIFICATE?</strong></p>
<p>Police Character Certificate (PCC) which is also called Police Clearance Report or Certificate is a certificate issued to individuals who live in Nigeria for a period of time to clarify that such person has no criminal records in Nigeria.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy, that for a foreigner to be eligible to apply for the police character certificate, the foreigner must have lived in Nigeria for a period of <strong>at least thirty (30) days.</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHO ISSUES THE POLICE CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE?</strong></p>
<p>The Police Clearance Certificate is issued by the Nigerian Police Force, usually at the Force Criminal Investigation Department, Police Criminal Registry, and in any Nigerian Police Criminal Registry in the 36 states.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO APPLY FOR A POLICE CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE?</strong></p>
<p>For an applicant to be able to apply for the PCC, the following requirement are needed to be present at the application and collection office in Nigeria.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> A valid International Passport (that in the bio-data page).</strong></li>
<li><strong> Two passport-size photographs.</strong></li>
<li><strong> An application fee (this varies from state to state).</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE FOR APPLICATION OF POLICE CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE</strong></p>
<p>If the applicant is in Nigeria, such an applicant can apply in person at the Police Central Criminal Registry in Lagos or any state the person is currently located.</p>
<p>The applicant will pay some application fees and collect the application form which would be filled either with blue or black ink and attach the passport photograph.</p>
<p>For the column that requires the applicant&#8217;s fingerprints, the officer in charge would guide the applicant on how to impute the applicant’s fingerprints, which include the five right fingers and the five left fingers.</p>
<p>After filling the form correctly, one shall submit it along with a copy of the international passport bio-data page to the officer in charge and then wait for the certificate to be processed.</p>
<p>After the forensic officer has analyzed and run a full background check on the applicant’s fingerprints and details, the certificate would be processed and issued accordingly.</p>
<p>The applicant must duly complete the application form, which will include the fingerprints of such applicants. The Nigerian Police Authorities will ensure that the fingerprints and all details provided by the applicant are duly queried or searched in their database to determine whether the applicant has a criminal record or not or before the certificate is issued.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Personal Income Tax (PIT) is a tax imposed on individuals including employees, partners in a partnership, unincorporated trusts, joint ventures, families and communities. It is imposed based on source and residency rules. The two key legislation are the Personal Income Tax Amendment Act 2011 (PITAM) and Finance Act 2020.</p>
<p>Personal Income Tax in Nigeria is on a Pay As You Earn (PAYE) basis, which means that the tax is deducted at the source by the employer as the employee earns the income. Every person who earns income either from employment or from running his own business must pay PERSONAL TAX to the State Internal Revenue Service. For those in employment, it is the responsibility of the employer to deduct tax from employee’s salaries and remit it to the relevant State Internal Revenue Service or FCT-IRS in the case of employees’ resident within the Federal Capital Territory. The people who run their own businesses have the responsibilities to pay their PAYE tax to relevant authorities.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, PAYE Income Tax is a calculation based on the amount you earn. Income tax is calculated on a threshold basis with different rates applied depending on your income.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule 6 PITA</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with Schedule 6 of PITA, the following guide can be followed in calculating the PAYE tax.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="208">Annual Taxable Income (NGN)</td>
<td width="208">Rates</td>
<td width="208">Tax payable per annum (NGN)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="208">First 300,000</td>
<td width="208">7%</td>
<td width="208">21,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="208">Next 300,000</td>
<td width="208">11%</td>
<td width="208">33,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="208">Next 500,000</td>
<td width="208">15%</td>
<td width="208">75,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="208">Next 500,000</td>
<td width="208">19%</td>
<td width="208">95,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="208">Next 1,600,000</td>
<td width="208">21%</td>
<td width="208">336,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="208">Above 3,200,000</td>
<td width="208">24%</td>
<td width="208">Multiply only the excess amount over NGN 3.2 million by 24%. For example, an annual taxable income of NGN 5 million is (5-3.2) million *24%= NGN 432,000.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those earning minimum wage or less from employment are exempted from personal income taxes.</p>
<p>As a result of the consolidated relief allowance of at most 21% of gross income, the top marginal tax rate is 18.96% for income above ₦20 million as only 79% of income is taxed at 24%, while for income below ₦20 million the top marginal rate is 19.2%.</p>
<p>Every taxable person (excluding persons who earn the minimum wage or below) is liable to a minimum income tax of 1% of their gross income. This is triggered where the actual tax payable after all reliefs and allowances is less than 1% of gross income. Minimum tax will not apply to a person in any year of assessment where such person earns the National Minimum Wage or less from an employment.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Benefits in Kind (S.4, 5) PITA</strong></p>
<p>Benefits in Kind (BIK) provided to an employee by the employer such as official cars, accommodation, etc. are deemed to be part of the employee’s gross emoluments. For items other than accommodation, the deemed annual benefit is 5% of the cost where the asset is owned by the employer, or the actual rent paid where the asset is leased by the employer.</p>
<p>BIK on accommodation is taxable based on the annual value of the premises as determined for purposes of local rates or as determined by the relevant tax authority.</p>
<p>Other things to take notice of concerning PAYE</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filing and due dates {S.41(3)} PITA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals are to file returns not later than 31 March annually in respect of the preceding year.</p>
<p>Employers are required to file the following documents:</p>
<ol>
<li>Employers’ Declaration Form (Form H1): showing the income of the employees, taxes deducted and remitted in the preceding year. This is due by 31 January.</li>
<li>Employers’ Remittance Card (Form G): showing the monthly remittances and reference number on the receipt. Copies of the receipt are to accompany the form G.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Declaration of estimated income and application for tax reliefs (Form A).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Due date for payment {S.41(3), 81} PITA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>PAYE must be remitted on or before the 10th day of the month following the payment of salary (e.g., PAYE tax deducted from January salary should be remitted by the 10th of February).</p>
<p>For individuals under direct assessment, payment must be made along with returns within 90 days of the fiscal year i.e., not later than 31 March.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correspondence &#8211; Notice of Assessment and Objections (S.58) PITA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Courier service, email and other electronic means are validly recognized as means of correspondence for issuance of assessment and raising valid objections.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Penalty for non-payment of tax (S.76, 77) PITA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The penalty for non-payment of PAYE is 10% per annum of the amount plus interest on an annual basis at the bank lending rate (in practice a one-off interest rate of 15% to 21% is applied). Late filing attracts a fine of ₦500,000 in the case of corporate bodies, and ₦50,000 in the case of individuals</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Statute of Limitation (S.55) PITA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The limitation applicable to PAYE tax liability is 6 years except in the event of fraud, willful default or neglect by the taxable person in which case there is no limitation.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The new Finance Bill signed into law on the 13<sup>th</sup> of January 2020 places more stringent penalties for default of payment of PAYE tax. It is a wake-up call for individuals and every Nigerian business owner to understand and diligently remit PAYE taxes to the relevant authorities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO INVESTIGATE PROPERTY TITLE IN LAGOS NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>Investigation of title to land is the process of confirming the title of the vendor or owner of the land as deduced by him. The aim of the investigation is to know if the title to the land is defective and ascertain if the land has a good title. Upon receipt of the epitome of title, the purchaser’s solicitor is to ascertain the genuity or otherwise of the documents. In Nigeria registration of title to land is mandatory however it is trite that registration of land in Nigeria does not cure defects in that title to land. See <strong>Omosanya</strong> <strong>v Anifowoshe (1959).</strong> Therefore, investigation of title to land is of utmost importance and should rank in priority over registration. It is the duty of the purchaser’s solicitor to investigate the title on behalf of his client in other to note defects in a property.</p>
<p>The stages of investigation are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Traditional investigation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is a meeting with members of the family wherein the family head or the head of the town will be present to verify the root of title, ownership of the land and to ascertain if the land is family-owned or individually owned.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Physical inspection of Land</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The importance of physical inspection cannot be overemphasized. This is usually done with a surveyor present alongside the purchaser’s solicitor. The aim of the physical inspection is to confirm the exact description and size of the property where the specific property to be purchased is already ascertained. It is also to ascertain if the land is vacant or encumbered. Some encumbered lands may be bare but would still contain warning signs such as Buyers beware /Caveat emptor to deter purchasers from buying land which is already encumbered. This would also reveal if the land is affected by any dispute.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Physical inspection of the documents </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This inspection of the document is to ascertain the real owner or owners of the land. It is also to know if all the relevant documents have been tendered and to ascertain the history of possession of the land, root of title and the authenticity of the documents.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Search at the Land Registry &amp; Surveyor General Office</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Conducting a search at the land registry and office of Surveyor-General is for the purpose of discovering any encumbrance on the property and to ascertain the true owners of the property. Only lands that have been registered can be searched for at the land registry. Any land, regardless of whether it is registered or not, can be charted at the office of Surveyor General. This search will reveal the true owner and position of the property as to acquisition by the government. It will also reveal other information such as whether the title documents presented by the seller are authentic, and if the land is registered, it will also reveal if there are any mortgages, liens, or other encumbrances on the property. In Lagos State, the land registry and office of Surveyor General are in Alausa, Ikeja.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Search at Corporate Affairs Commission</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Asides from a search at the land registry, lands that belong to corporations incorporated under the Companies and Allied Matters Act should be subjected to a further search at the Corporate Affairs Commission. This is to reveal if there are encumbrances on the company that can affect the title to the property such as floating or fixed charges.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Search at the Probate Registry</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is important in cases where the seller became the beneficiary of the land by virtue of a will. It is important to search at the probate registry to ascertain the true administrators or executors of the estate, as well as the validity of the grant of Letter of Administration or Probate. The probate registries are located and part of the High Court of States.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As an intending purchaser seeking to purchase land or any landed property in Lagos or any part of Nigeria, it is advised that most stages as stated above should be adhered to before purchasing any property. This will help any intending purchaser to avoid buying a property with defective titles.  It is therefore very important to conduct a proper search and do due diligence before purchasing any lands in Nigeria.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nigerian product liability law, as it currently stands, is still anchored on the fault-based principle as formulated in the case of Donoghue v Stevenson.</p>
<p>For a product liability claim, a claimant must be able to prove the following elements of negligence; duty of care, breach of duty, and causation resulting in damages before he can succeed in an action premised on product defect.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>DEFINITION OF LEGAL CONCEPTS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>CONSUMER &#8211;</strong> A consumer has been defined as: ‘<strong><em>one who buys goods or services for personal, family, or household use, with no desire of reselling same</em></strong>.’ This definition, though appropriate under certain circumstances, for instance within the ambit of contract law, however, does not in any way assist in defining a consumer under tort mechanism, it limits rather than widen its meaning.</li>
<li><strong>MANUFACTURER </strong>&#8211; A manufacturer is defined as: ‘<strong><em>A person or entity engaged in producing or assembling new products.</em></strong> This definition does not fully cover the various classes of people who have been regarded as manufacturers. A manufacturer/producer within the context of product liability claim has been extended to include retailers and even in some jurisdictions repairers of the product.</li>
<li><strong>NEGLIGENCE </strong>&#8211; is defined as ‘the failure to exercise the standard of care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised in a similar situation; any conduct that falls below the legal standard established to prevent others against unreasonable risk of harm, except for conduct that is intentionally, wantonly, or wilfully disregardful of others’ right. Negligence is a matter of risk – that is to say, of the recognizable danger of injury. In most instances, it is caused by heedlessness or inadvertence, by which the negligent party is unaware of the result, which may follow his act. In the case of <strong><em>Abubakar v Joseph</em></strong>, the Supreme Court defined negligence as ‘&#8230; the omission or failure to do something which a reasonable man under similar circumstances would do, or the doing something which a reasonable man would not do.’ It can safely be inferred that acts, which fall short of the standard of a reasonable person, will be adjudged to be negligent ones.</li>
<li><strong>PRODUCT LIABILITY</strong> &#8211; Product liability can be described as that area of the law that seeks to hold accountable manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, retailers, and others who make products available to the public for the injuries those products inflict on consumers or users. It is the body of principles of the law as found in the statute books and case law that govern the liability of manufacturers/sellers for the injuries/losses caused by defects in their products to consumers and the public at large. While products are generally thought of as tangible personal property,</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CAUSE OF ACTION AND JURISDICTION</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Section 272 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), confers jurisdiction on the High Court to hear and determine any civil proceedings, which the existence or extent of a legal right, power, duty, and liability is in the issue. As such, the court with jurisdiction in an action for product liability is the High Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FEDERAL COMPETITION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMISSION(FCCPC)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The FCCPC, under the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act (FCCPA), is the main authority charged with the primary responsibility of protecting and safeguarding the rights of consumers in Nigeria. It is empowered by law to, amongst other things, enforce the FCCPA and any other enactment concerning competition and protection of consumers. The FCCPC is also authorized to carry out investigations or inquiries; resolve disputes or complaints, issue directives and apply sanctions where necessary; regulate and seek ways and means of removing or eliminating from the market, hazardous goods, and services11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DUTY OF CARE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For a consumer to succeed in an action for product liability founded on negligence, the consumer must by pleadings and evidence establish the three essential ingredients of negligence, to wit:</p>
<ol>
<li>That the manufacturer owes him or her a duty of care;</li>
<li>That the duty of care was breached by the manufacturer; and</li>
<li>That he or she has suffered damage as a result of the breach of the duty</li>
</ol>
<p>of care.</p>
<p>The first element is easily satisfied when the manufacturer-consumer relationship is established. The second element requires the consumer to show the action or inaction of the manufacturer that has led to the breach of the duty. In other words, what step was taken by the manufacturer that it ought not to have taken, or what the manufacturer failed to do, that was required of it either by statute or the standard expected of a reasonable man. The third element requires the consumer to establish a direct link between the damage suffered and the breach of the duty by the manufacturer. Where the manufacturer can show that there is no connection between the damage suffered by a consumer and its products, then the consumer will not succeed on this claim.</p>
<p>The consumer is required to not only prove the three elements aforementioned, but his or her case must stand on its strength and not the weakness of the manufacturer&#8217;s defence. Where the consumer, prima facie establishes a case</p>
<p>of negligence, the evidential burden shifts to the manufacturer to exonerate itself.</p>
<p>Where the consumer successfully establishes negligence, the consumer will be entitled to damages, and the manufacturer’s liability cannot be restricted or excluded by any reference to any contract term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HOW CAN A LIABILITY CLAIM BE BROUGHT?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Aggrieved consumers seeking to enforce any of the rights under the FCCPA may file a complaint directly with the FCCPC or directly file an action in court. The aggrieved consumers may have recourse to Civil Society Groups who can also grant redress to victims of defective/poor goods or services.</p>
<p>Where a consumer does not hinge his or her claim on the FCCPA, recourse will only be had to the Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LIMITATION OF PERIOD</p>
<p>The limitation periods applicable in a product liability action would depend on whether the cause of action is one arising out of contract or tort. Each state of Nigeria has enacted a limitation law. The Limitation Act (Decree No. 88 of the Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1966) is applicable in the FCT. There is a slight difference in the periods of limitation in certain states. In Lagos state, claims founded on contract or tort are subject to a limitation period of six years from the date the cause of action accrued. Claims for damages arising from negligence or breach of duty of care involving personal injury must be instituted within three years of the date the cause of action accrued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The risk of product liability is fundamental in every business involved in the manufacturing or distribution of goods. The consequences that come with it can be very hurtful, ranging from minor distractions or temporary disruptions of business</p>
<p>activities to a total shut down of a business, either as a result of a court decision.</p>
<p>However, it is thus imperative for manufacturers to take all necessary steps to minimize the exposures as well as to properly manage a product liability crisis.</p>
<p>Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms should be explored as much as possible because of the less public nature of the proceedings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> LICENSE FOR CAPITAL MARKET OPERATORS IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>Under Nigerian law, any company or individual seeking to offer any capital market-related services must be licensed or registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nigeria&#8217;s capital market is majorly a market for long-term investment where the issuing and trading of corporate equities and long-term debt securities are done. The capital market is a strong pull of Nigeria&#8217;s economic growth and it is primarily regulated by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Other regulators include the Nigerian Stock Exchange Commission, which regulates listing at the stock exchange, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).</p>
<p>The primary legislation governing the capital market is the <strong>Investment and Securities Act (ISA). </strong>Section 38 of the <strong>Investment and Securities Act 2007 </strong>provides as follows:</p>
<p><strong><em>“(1) No persons shall- </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> (a) operate in the Nigerian capital market as an expert or professional or in any other capacity as may be determined by the Commission; or  </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> (b) carry on investments and securities business unless the person is registered in accordance with this Act and the rules and regulations made thereunder. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(2) The Commission shall prescribe the conditions for registration including the level of knowledge and skill required to operate in the capital market  </em></strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, Section 315 of the ISA defines what it entails to engage in securities business where it provides as follows:</p>
<p>Section 315 of the Investment and Securities Act, 2007</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Dealing in Securities&#8221; means (whether as principal or agent) making or offering to make with any person, or including or attempting to induce any person to enter into or to offer to enter into:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(a) any agreement for or with a view to acquiring, disposing or subscribing for, or underwriting of securities: or</strong></p>
<p><strong>(b) any agreement the purpose of pretended purpose of securing a profit to any of the parties from the yield of securities or by reference to fluctuations in the price of securities.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Consequently, every entity seeking to offer or provide any services must be duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Rule 46 of the SEC Rules and Regulations made pursuant to the Investment and Securities Act 2007 (ISA) provides the lists of regulated operators of the capital market as follows;</p>
<ol>
<li>Issuing Houses/ Merchant Bankers;</li>
<li>Underwriters;</li>
<li>Brokers/ Dealers;</li>
<li>Sub-Brokers;</li>
<li>Receiving Bankers;</li>
<li>Registrars;</li>
<li>Trustees</li>
<li>Investment Advisers (Corporate And Individual);</li>
<li>Fund/ Portfolio Managers;</li>
<li>Rating Agencies;</li>
<li>Market Makers</li>
<li>Custodians.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission, being the ombudsman of the investment and securities industry, has a pivotal role to play as the real essence of law and ethics in the industry is to build a fair, efficient and transparent financial market. Thus, this has borne a mandatory regulation that all capital market operators be registered, and each is required to be members of one or more Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs).</p>

<p>The guidelines on national roaming issued on Monday aimed to improve network quality of service delivery to subscribers in unserved and underserved communities across the country.</p>
<p>Also, the guideline on infrastructure sharing would ensure unnecessary duplication of infrastructure was minimized or completely avoided.</p>
<p>The commission described roaming service as the ability of a mobile subscriber to automatically make and receive voice calls, send and receive data, or access other services when traveling outside a particular network geographical area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Operators in the downstream sector of the Nigeria petroleum industry are demanding special legislation to support the deregulation of the sector and save it from the danger of policy summersault, writes Peter Uzoho</p>
<p>Notwithstanding their consensus endorsement of the deregulation of the downstream sector of the Nigerian oil and gas industry by the current federal government, operators in the sector are demanding legislation to back the deregulation up.</p>
<p>After years of resistance to the clamor for a free market regime in the nation’s downstream sector that would allow the pricing of petrol to be determined by market forces and end government’s meddlesomeness in petrol pricing, the federal government finally listened to the voice of reason. Last September, the government announced, to the excitement of a good number of Nigerians, downstream operators/oil marketers, economic policy analysts, and the international economic/ monetary policy bodies, the deregulation of the sector, particularly petrol price-fixing.</p>
<p>By that move, marketers of petroleum products can now import petrol and fix pump prices while taking into account all the market fundamentals. The new pricing dispensation equally offers marketers increased margins with which they can play and make decent returns. The downstream deregulation had been projected to open up space for more investments, increase local participation in the sector, bring in more money into the government’s coffers, and allow the government to channel its limited resources to the development of critical sectors rather than spending it on petrol subsidy.</p>
<p>However, as brilliant and beneficial as this deregulation would be for the nation, especially considering the present state of the national economy, downstream operators believe that there is a need to legitimize it by enacting a law to back it up.</p>
<p>Although, the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) which is currently before the National Assembly provides for the establishment of a single regulatory body for the midstream and downstream sectors under the name: ‘Nigerian Midstream-Downstream Regulatory Authority (NMDRA), it does not make provision for the legalization of the downstream deregulation.</p>
<p>The operators said that lack of legal provision for the downstream deregulation is a major vacuum that needs to be filled if the government wants them and Nigerians to have trust in the policy.</p>
<p>The oil marketers who dissected the “Post-Deregulation Agenda for Nigerian Downstream Petroleum,” at the recent virtual Oil Trading and Logistics (OTL) Africa Downstream Week, espoused the concepts of self-regulation, discipline, and standard-setting as important components of the new dispensation which can be driven by consultations between industry associations and the industry regulator.</p>
<p>They said their major concerns border on how business, laws, and policy converge to deliver value to all stakeholders in the industry. These, according to them, include thoughts on the competition, self-regulation, the market itself, issues of pricing, and aspirations of the PIB transiting into the Petroleum Industry Act.</p>
<p>In his intervention at the session, the Managing Director of OVH Energy Marketing, Mr. Hubb Stokman, raised doubts as to the sincerity of government’s intention to deregulate the market.</p>
<p>“While the government has categorically stated its intention to deregulate the market, removal of subsidy is not the same thing as deregulation, as deregulation has to be backed by law”, Stokman said.</p>
<p>He said that to have effective downstream deregulation, three building blocks comprising fair market practices, consumer protection, and sound legislation were required.</p>
<p>According to Stokman, “The existence of a fair interest credit market is all about operating on a level playing field to avoid market distortion. Elements of fairness, in this case, include market-driven pricing based on operators’ structural efficiencies; equitable and transparent access to foreign exchange and access to infrastructures such as pipelines, jetties, and depots on equal terms.”</p>
<p>He called for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which is present in every step of the downstream petroleum value chain, to adhere to commercial processes and play by the same rules.</p>
<p>“Deregulation must be built on the bedrock of legislation as the law needs to remain valid into the future. The legislation needs to be an act of parliament that will eliminate government interference and ensure that price regulation cannot be introduced under any guise.</p>
<p>“Consequently, there should be a review of current legislation, while the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) need to be repurposed,” he said.</p>
<p>In the area of consumer protection, the OVH Energy boss pointed out the necessity of establishing an authority to ensure fairness for consumers and operators.</p>
<p>“The body will be required to focus on price monitoring; regulate market competition to eliminate predatory business practices; enforce compliance with technical approved standards and enforce sanctions for violations”, he explained.</p>
<p>Highlighting the concept of self-regulation in the new dispensation, the Chairman of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), Mr. Tunji Oyebanji, said the industry’s vulnerability to corruption and sharp practices also contributed to calls for deregulation.</p>
<p>Oyebanji warned against the erroneous notion that deregulation means a lack of regulation, explaining that “on the contrary, self-regulation is the best form of regulation to encourage best practices and build confidence and trust in the industry.</p>
<p>“To be driven by industry associations, self-regulation must brace up over and beyond what is provided in the PIB and develop based on industry operations”.</p>
<p>He noted that in a deregulated market, industry associations would be required to consult and contribute to guidelines provided by the official regulator.</p>
<p>Oyebanji, who is also the Managing Director of 11Plc (formerly Mobil), however, referenced the activities of vibrant industry associations such as the South African Petroleum Retailers Association (SAPRA); the Petroleum Institute of East Africa and the American Petroleum Institute (API).</p>
<p>He outlined some action points for industry associations, among which were promoting Health, Safety, Environment, and Quality (HSEQ), attracting investment, regulating standards, and advising on global policy issues such as climate change.</p>
<p>He added that the industry associations also provide advice on business development models, lobby policymakers, facilitate the security of petroleum products supply, and develop sustainable standards that are widely cited by the international regulatory community.</p>
<p>The MOMAN chairman encouraged industry associations to establish charters on dos and don’ts for their operators, focus on HSEQ, corporate governance, services, and methods of implementing rules and sanctions.</p>
<p>He equally tasked the proposed industry regulator to collaborate with industry associations to take appropriate action.</p>
<p>In a review of provisions of the National Petroleum Policy (NPP) in view of Nigeria’s ambitions in the petroleum industry, the Executive Secretary of MOMAN, Mr. Clement Isong, reiterated the significant role of industry associations in a deregulated market.</p>
<p>Quoting the NPP, he said: “Around the world, technical standards are usually developed by industry consultations, while standards are produced by technical committees of industry associations.</p>
<p>“Industry needs to engage with the regulator to develop consistent technical standards and regulations in areas such as HSEQ, consumer protection, product quality, corporate governance, and ethics and human resources development.”</p>
<p>Going forward, Isong said that the intention of the policy was to avoid unnecessary costs.</p>
<p>He further said: “If we are going to be competitive and keep prices down, the industry needs to get policies and economics right across the value chain to guarantee full cost recovery and investment in logistics optimization.</p>
<p>“We have not done very well in the past three decades and the petroleum sector has been dominated by state ownership and dominant market power.</p>
<p>“Consequently, the private sector has been constrained while the lack of regulation impacts governance and cost-efficiency. As a result, state control has limited the growth of self-sustaining industries”.</p>
<p>Also contributing at the session, the Chairman, Energy Institute Nigeria, Mr. Osten Olorunsola, expressed optimism that the PIB, if hinged on critical success factor, would soon morph into the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).</p>
<p>He listed some of those factors to include corporate governance, level playing field, commercial operations, robust regulation, and effective collaborations.</p>
<p>Olorunsola, while asserting that the downstream petroleum industry would be primed for business when the PIB transited into the PIA, also highlighted possible benefits of the regime.</p>
<p>“We will witness increased revenue and an improved economy; significant impact on cost savings; and reduction in overhead costs.</p>
<p>“The legally backed deregulation framework will also ensure quality and security of product supply, create jobs and develop improved capacity to sustain the industry”, he said.</p>
<p>Examining the legal perspectives of the deregulation saga, the Senior Partner, Akabogu, and Associates, Mr. Emeka Akabogu, queried the legitimacy of the deregulation regime as announced by the PPPRA and promoted by the NNPC.</p>
<p>Akabogu, who advocated for a full-blown change of the law for deregulation to exist, stated that the removal of fuel subsidy has not changed anything.</p>
<p>He faulted the position of the Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, who posited that deregulation was a policy issue and that petroleum product pricing was not a subject of any law.</p>
<p>Asserting that petroleum prices in Nigeria are still controlled, Akabogu said it was important for the market to realize that against the backdrop of extant laws in the petroleum industry, the laws provide for price-fixing by the government. He said until those laws were changed, anything being done now was just pandering to market and budgeting realities which may change at any time.</p>
<p>“If you look at section 6 of the Petroleum Act, the Minister of Petroleum is able to fix prices. In section 5 of the Price Control Act, the government can fix prices of some goods including petroleum products and it can be deemed a criminal offense if products are sold above such a fixed price.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, in section 9 of the Petroleum Act, the Minister can determine the amount of crude oil to be supplied to a refinery and the price at which the refinery may sell its refined products”, Akabuogu argued.</p>
<p>According to him, these are the realities of the situation until the industry transits from the Petroleum Act and the existing legislation to the Petroleum Industry Act in order to have any semblance of deregulation.</p>
<p>He advised that pending transition of the law, realities require the industry to conduct due diligence and ensure that the government offers more guarantees for trading and increased investments within the segment.</p>
<p>This, he said, may come in the form of gazetting the policy and in the short-term, repealing the PPPRA Act; the Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF) Act; the Price Control Act; and the relevant provisions of the PIA immediately.</p>
<p>Akabogu also called on the industry to engage on the PIB and peruse it carefully to unearth hidden conditions which may assail the principles of the policy.</p>
<p>Particularly, he drew attention to clause 31 (L) of the bill which makes provision for the authority to develop and endorse a framework for tariff and pricing for natural gas and petroleum products.</p>
<p>He also highlighted clause 122 (6) of the bill, with the provision for the authority to, due to the exigency of the circumstances, establish a tariff methodology without a stakeholders’ consultation where it considers it necessary to do so.</p>
<p>Akabogu suggested that the industry needed to engage with the bill from a position of knowledge to deal with several other such ambiguities.</p>
<p>He stated that without a doubt, investments in the sector must be made on the strength of certainties and constitutional guarantees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The stock market capitalization hit N16.207 trillion last week following sustained demand for equities.<br />
The unprecedented demand for stocks had lifted the market by N1.93 trillion to close the month of October at N15.958 trillion.</p>
<p>Although some level of profit-taking was recorded, the positive performance was sustained in the first week of November, driving indices to new highs.<br />
Precisely, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index rose 1.56 percent to close at 31,016.17, while market capitalization added N249 billion to be at N16.207 trillion.<br />
Consequently, the year-to-date (YTD) performance improved to 15.6 percent, with analysts saying there was still scope for expansion going forward.</p>
<p>“As the Q3 earnings season winds down, we expect investors to shift their attention to yet to be published results from the big banks in the week ahead. In the short term, we still see scope for expansion in valuation multiples as the hunt for alpha-yielding opportunities in the face of increasingly negative real returns in the fixed income market remains positive for stocks. “However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” analysts at Cordros Research said.</p>
<p>Also commenting, analysts at Greenwich Research said: “Positive sentiment, boosted by impressive earnings performance continued to spur interest in the equities space, in the face of record-low yields in the fixed income space. Notably, gains recorded at the start and the end of the week pinned the market in the green zone.</p>
<p>“We expect this momentum will be sustained by positive Q3 earnings results, particularly from the banking space.”<br />
In all, investors traded 2.067 billion shares worth N22.636 billion in 25,187deals last week in contrast to a total of 1.909 billion shares valued at N23.610billion that exchanged hands the preceding week.</p>
<p>The Financial Services industry led the activity chart with 1.575 billion shares valued at N13.725 billion traded in 14,521deals. The Consumer Goods Industry followed with 178.574million shares worth N3.609billion in 4,669deals while third place was occupied by the Conglomerate Industry, with a turnover of 102.697million shares worth N155.195 million in 599 deals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 40 equities appreciated at price during the week, lower than 68 equities in the previous week, just as 24 equities depreciated in price, higher than six equities in the previous week.<br />
Livestock Feeds Plc led the price gainers with 30.8 percent trailed by Transnational Corporations of Nigeria Plc with 19.7 percent. Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc chalked up 19.5 percent, while CAP Plc added 13.0 percent. LASACO Assurance Plc garnered 12.5 percent, just as Coronation Insurance Plc gained 10 percent.</p>
<p>Other top price gainers included: Portland Paints &amp; Products Nigeria Plc (9.5 percent); Regency Assurance Plc, Dangote Cement Plc (9.1 apiece), and Consolidated Hallmark Insurance Plc (8.8 percent).<br />
Conversely, International Breweries Plc led the price losers with 11.8 percent. AXA Mansard Insurance Plc shed 9.1 percent, while Linkage Assurance Plc shed 8.8 percent.</p>
<p>Custodian Investment Plc went down by 8.2 percent, just as NEM Insurance Plc and BUA Cement Plc 8.1 percent and 5.4 percent respectively.<br />
Other top price losers include Mutual Benefits Assurance Plc (4.7 percent); Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, Union Bank of Nigeria (4.4 percent apiece); and Union Diagnostic &amp; Clinical Services Plc (3.8 percent).</p>
