										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nigerian Police Service Commission was established under <strong><em>Section 153</em></strong> of the <strong><em>Nigerian constitution</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Police Service Commission Establishment Act</em></strong> of 2001. The commission is an oversight body over the <a href="https://www.npf.gov.ng/">Nigeria Police Force</a>. It has the power to appoint, promote and discipline all police officers of the Nigerian Police Force except the Inspector General of Police.</p>
<p>Section 6 Nigerian Police Service Commission Establishment Act provides the functions and powers of the Nigeria Police Service Commission as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>They shall be responsible for the appointment and promotions of persons to offices in the Nigerian Police Force (other than the office of the Inspector General of Police).</li>
<li>Dismiss and exercise disciplinary control over persons (other than the Inspector-General of Police) in the Nigerian Police Force;</li>
<li>Formulate policies and guidelines for the appointment, promotion, discipline and dismissal of officers of the Nigerian Police Force;</li>
<li>Identify factors inhibiting or undermining discipline in the Nigeria Police Force;</li>
<li>Formulate and implement policies aimed at the efficiency and discipline of the Nigeria Police Force;</li>
<li>Perform such other functions which in the opinion of the Commission are required to ensure the optimal efficiency of the Nigeria Police Force; and</li>
<li>Carry out such other functions as the President may, from time to time, direct.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>REPORTING POLICE OFFICER FOR MISCONDUCT</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In a case of misconduct by a Police Officer, the Commission has the right to dismiss and exercise disciplinary control over any person holding office in the Nigerian Police Force other than the Inspector General of Police. Section 131 of the Police Act provides that the Inspector General of Police is to create a Police Complaints Response Unit at the headquarters of the Nigeria Police Force. A complaint can be made against a Police officer found to be compromising rules of engagement of the Force. Such complaint can be made by calling the following numbers 07034072677, 07034072676 or via email to <a href="mailto:info@psc.gov.ng">info@psc.gov.ng</a>. All complaints received will be investigated and a false complaint will be prosecuted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GUIDELINES FOR DISCIPLINE IN THE NIGERIA POLICE FORCE FOR MINOR OFFENCES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Offences for which disciplinary action may be taken against an officer of the force are of two kinds, minor offences and serious offences. A minor offence or misconduct shall include any act, wrongdoing or omission of which the prescribed punishment in case of conviction in a criminal proceeding does not exceed a term of six months. Such Minor Offences include and are not limited to; Improper dressing, driving Police vehicles when not properly dressed, Lateness to duty, Incivility to members of the public, smoking in prohibited areas, drinking alcohol while on duty and disregard for general rules and regulations. The categories of punishment include warning, minor fees, confinement to barracks, compulsory community service and extension of work hours.</p>
<p>Superior police officers at various commands of The Nigerian Police force may discipline subordinates for minor offences after due investigation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GUIDELINES FOR DISCIPLINE IN THE NIGERIA POLICE FORCE FOR MAJOR OFFENCES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For Major Offences, Section 131 of the Police Act provides that the Complaint unit established by the Inspector General of Police shall receive a complaint alleging that the conduct of an officer of the force resulted in death, serious injury or gross violation of human rights. It can also receive complaints showing that an officer has committed a criminal offence.</p>
<p>These allegations of Major offences/ misconducts are to be investigated by the Police complaints response unit. The police officer that has a complaint made against him shall be allowed to defend himself. The police complaint unit is to conduct its investigation within 21 days from the day the complaint was made and forward the report to the Inspector General of Police or the Police service Commission of the state through the Public Relations Officer in the state or the Public Relations Officer in the Federal Capital Territory. The Inspector General of Police upon receiving reports of the investigation and recommendations will send them to the Police Service Commission for proper disciplinary action.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the police response complaint unit does not affect the right of an aggrieved individual to seek legal remedies in the court of law against an officer of the force.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lawyers and law firms are traditionally hired to render legal services. Most lawyers in Lagos Nigeria offer legal services and may also serve as attorneys and representatives to various persons in both corporate and commercial matters. In considering how to hire a lawyer in Lagos Nigeria, many factors must be considered.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, lawyers may be employed for a single matter or on a retainership basis. In getting an experienced lawyer to hire in Nigeria, some of the important factors that must be considered will be briefly discussed below.</p>
<p><strong>MАKING A LIST OF РRОЅРЕСTIVЕ LАWУЕRЅ</strong></p>
<p>In compiling a list of lawyers, one must have regard to both online sources and referrals. With a search on the internet, one can identify lаwуеrѕ who have special expertise in the in a particular practice area. Furthermore, there are various online directories through where lawyers may be contacted.</p>
<p>In considering offline sources, one may choose to ask family, friends, or business associates who might have probably engaged a particular lawyer for a similar service required.</p>
<p><strong>CONTACT УОUR РRОЅРЕСTЅ</strong></p>
<p>Upon listing some suitable lawyers, one may choose to reach out to each lawyer or law firm individually to ask some specific questions. By doing this, someone may narrow the search to a single or multiple firm or lawyers. In contacting a list of prospective lawyers, it is disrespectful to simply send an email conspicuously copying many lawyers or law firms at the same time. Most lawyers do not respond to this type of general inquiry. Furthermore, where the preliminary questions are becoming very long and touching on a specific subject matter or legal service a client requires a lawyer for, some lawyers may impose a consultation fee in such a circumstance. By and large, most lawyers and law firms in Lagos offer free consultations to a certain extent, it depends on a particular law firm.</p>
<p>After reaching out to the prospective lawyers and getting different responses, one should have an idea of the type of lawyers to be engaged. Some of the other important factors to be considered before hiring a lawyer include the followings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gооd соmmuniсаtiоn:</strong> By getting a response from a specific lawyer, one will find evidence of good communication skills or not. Some of the essential elements of good communication include listening, friendliness, clarity, and empathy. To hire any lawyer, such a lawyer must demonstrate all or some of the mentioned behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experience and expertise:</strong> some legal services require unique knowledge or expertise. For some legal matters that need special expertise, it is crucial to check whether the prospective lawyer or law firm to be engaged is knowledgeable in such an area. The best way to discover this is to ask the lawyer whether he has personally handled similar matters or services or has a colleague he can refer you to. Additionally, most law firms in Nigeria usually list their areas of practice on their website, so you may visit the law firm’s website to discover the types of legal services they offer.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal Fееѕ</strong>: legal services could be costly sometimes. Lawyers in Lagos may charge for legal work on an hourly and fixed basis. It is important to clarify or ask about a method of charge by an engaged lawyer before asking him or her to commence the legal work. Where no specific fees are agreed upon before commencement of legal service with a lawyer or law firm, the client might be billed on <strong><em>quantum meruit</em></strong>. For clarity, it is important to agree on a specific amount or method of charges before engaging a law firm or lawyer. If the law firm offers a fixed rate, one may opt for a fixed-rate charge, as it is most cost-effective. However, the fixed rate may not apply to a multi-dynamic type of legal service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ENGAGING A LAWYER OR LAW FIRM</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After settling on a lawyer and you have briefed him or her, you may ask the firm or lawyer to provide an engagement letter or contract, which serves as a contractual agreement between a lawyer and a client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the above factors must be bored in mind before hiring a lawyer in Lagos to avoid any uncertainty or ambiguity in the course of the engagement. It is relevant to state that where someone is not sure whether a particular lawyer is fake or authentic, such a person may check the website of the <a href="https://nigerianbar.org.ng/find-lawyer">Nigerian Bar Association (NBA),</a> which is an umbrella and mandatory association for all lawyers in Nigeria. The names of all genuine lawyers in Nigeria are listed on the website.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A private lending company is a company engaged in consumer and commercial money lending operations in Nigeria. This means the business of giving customers a loan with the agreement that it will be paid at a later agreed date with interest rates accrued on it. Private lending companies are subject to the regulation of the Money Lending Law of the various states of the Federation. <strong>Section 2</strong> of the Money Lending Law states that <strong><em>“Money Lending includes every person whose business is that of money lending or who carries out or advertises or announces himself or holds himself to anyway as carrying on business, whether or not he also possesses or owns property or money derived from sources other than the lending of money and whether or not he carries on businesses as a principal or agent”.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>How to Start a Private Lending Company</strong></p>
<p>The first step to consider is to register the private lending company with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). With the registration, the private lending company can open a corporate account with any bank in Nigeria for business purposes. Registering the company and having a corporate account builds the credibility of the private lending company and can boost the chances of attracting investors and clients to the company.</p>
<p>The next step is to obtain the required money lending license from the government issuing authority to operate a private lending company. Only companies licensed as money lending businesses are permitted to legitimately engage in lending operations in Nigeria.</p>
<p><strong>Application Process for Money Lending License</strong></p>
<p>The steps to apply for Money Lending License to legally operate a private lending company must be strictly adhered to before Money Lending License can be granted.</p>
<p>The proposed private lending company must make a formal application to the Chief Magistrate within the jurisdiction where the business is to operate. The application is to be made on the company’s letterhead with the Company’s seal affixed to it.</p>
<p>The application for a Money Lending License in Lagos State is to be accompanied by the following documents;</p>
<ul>
<li>A cover letter with the company’s seal attached.</li>
<li>The office address of the individual or corporate applicant.</li>
<li>Certificate of Incorporation of the Company.</li>
<li>Certified True Copy of the CAC application Forms.</li>
<li>Memorandum and Articles of Association of the proposed lending company. The object clause of the company must include money lending business or financial service.</li>
<li>Tax Clearance of the proposed private lending company. Where the proposed private lending company is newly registered, there must be evidence that the company is a registered taxpayer.</li>
<li>Police clearance from the Commissioner of Police for two (2) directors of the proposed private lending company.</li>
<li>Evidence of maintaining an office by the proposed private lending company.</li>
<li>Evidence of maintenance of a current account with a recognized licensed bank.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon application to the Chief Magistrate, the proposed private lending company will be issued a Form B and C. After obtaining the required Forms, the proposed private lending company is to further make a formal application to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Tourism.</p>
<p>The application to the Ministry of Home Affairs is to be accompanied by the following additional document:</p>
<ul>
<li>A formal application letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Tourism.</li>
<li>Certificate of Incorporation of the Company.</li>
<li>Evidence of payment of application fee into the Lagos State Government Account.</li>
<li>Money Lending Ordinance (Form B) 19W8, issued from the Magistrate Court.</li>
<li>A duly completed Magistrate Form C.</li>
<li>A police report from the Commissioner of Police showing fingerprints of the Directors of the Company.</li>
<li>3 years Income Tax Clearance for the Directors of the proposed Company.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final stage of the requirement to start a private lending company is the visitation and physical inspection of the intended office by the government officials. Upon visitation, if the company is already involved in lending operations, the books will be inspected too.</p>
<p>Where the statutory requirements have been satisfactory complied with by the proposed private lending company, the Money Lending License will be issued and it lasts for a period of January-December to be renewed annually.</p>
<p>Finally, a private lending company must obtain the required money lending license to legitimately carry on the business of consumer and commercial lending in Nigeria. A money lending company that failed to obtain a required license before carrying on business may be sanctioned by the appropriate authorities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NIGERIA NOTAP REGISTRATION </strong></p>
<p>The National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP) is a government agency with the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology charged with the responsibility of implementing the acquisition, development, and transfer of foreign technology into Nigeria. It is governed by the <strong>National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion Act CAP N62 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN) 2004.</strong>  One of the activities of NOTAP is the registration of all Nigerian technology transfer agreements and contracts entered into for the transfer of technology to Nigerian parties. It is important to note that NOTAP requires registration of technology transfer agreements in sectors such as finance and insurance, manufacturing, franchising, technical services, management services, technical know-how, oil and gas, civil construction and power and energy, etc.  The procedure for the registration of a technology transfer agreement with NOTAP will be briefly explained in below.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure for NOTAP Registration</strong></p>
<p>Application for the registration of technology transfer agreement with NOTAP is made in the applicant&#8217;s company letterhead paper directed to the Director of NOTAP within thirty (30) days from the effective date of the agreement. <strong>Section 5</strong> of the NOTAP Act provides that <strong><em>&#8220;every contract or agreement which on the date of the coming into force of this Act had been entered into by any person in Nigeria and which still has an effect on the commencement of this Act in relation to any matter shall be registered with the National Office in the prescribed manner not later than six months after the commencement of this Act&#8221;.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 5(3)</strong> goes further to state that every application for the registration of a contract or agreement shall be addressed to the director and shall be accompanied by a number of certified true copies of the contract and agreement and by all other related documents annexed thereto.</p>
<p>Applicants are required to make payment of a presentation fee of <strong>N50, 000 (Fifty Thousand Naira)</strong> through the NOTAP online portal to commence registration, accompanied with the following information and documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy of the duly completed application form.</li>
<li>Certificate of Incorporation with the Corporate Affairs Commission.</li>
<li>Memorandum and Article of Association of the company.</li>
<li>A duly completed TAA Pre-Qualification Form.</li>
<li>Tax Payer Identification Number (TIN).</li>
<li>A draft copy of the Technology Transfer Agreement to be registered.</li>
<li>A copy of the duly completed NOTAP questionnaires for different sectors.</li>
<li>A duly completed copy of the Monitoring Form.</li>
<li>A copy of the feasibility study report of the company.</li>
<li>Annual audited accounts for the preceding three years.</li>
<li>Evidence of tax payment for the preceding three years.</li>
<li>Profile of the technical partner.</li>
<li>Performance bond for advanced payment.</li>
<li>A comprehensive training programme which must include the number of personnel, skill or knowledge to be acquired.</li>
<li>Approval or licenses obtained from the relevant authorities and bodies such as the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) for agreements on communication etc, where applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon the submission and evaluation of the technology transfer agreement, all issues, observations will be addressed by the agency before the approval of the registration through an official letter to the applicant. NOTAP evaluates the agreement in terms of its legal, economic, and technical benefits to the Nigerian economy before registration.</p>
<p>The registration with NOTAP can be granted upon conditions in some cases, where it is satisfied that it would be in the national best interest to grant same, although the agreement can still be subject to modifications adjustments, and submission of other documents such as tax clearance certificate, invoices, etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the registration can be successfully granted without conditions in writing by NOTAP, where it is certain that the scope of services contained in the technology transfer agreement is fair to both parties involved and there is value for money. In another sense, the application for registration can be rejected by NOTAP where it is observed that the technological interest of Nigeria is not considered in the negotiation, drafting, and implementation of the technology transfer agreement. It can also be rejected where the agreement contravenes the laws of Nigeria.</p>
<p>Finally, a Certificate of Registration is issued and granted to the applicant with the original copy of the agreement, which has been certified by Director- General of NOTAP.</p>
<p><strong>Fees Payable for the Registration with NOTAP</strong></p>
<p>The following official fees must be made through the NOTAP online Remita platform, as the printout page containing the Remita Retrieval Reference (RRR) will be submitted to NOTAP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation fee- N50, 000 (Fifty Thousand Naira).</li>
<li>The penalty fee for contracts not submitted for registration within 30 days of the effective date – N100, 000 (One Hundred Thousand Naira).</li>
<li>For contracts involving payments, the fees payable ranges from N150,000 (One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira) to N20,000,000 (Twenty Million Naira), depending on the payment involved in the contract.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional requirements for registration</strong></p>
<p>There are also general rules and guidelines provided by NOTAP for companies to adhere to before registration. Some of these requirements are as follows;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;">ATTESTATION OF MARITAL STATUS</h3>
<p>A single status certificate is an affidavit that testifies to the fact that a man or woman has never been married before and that there is no record within the country (Nigeria) in this instance of the person being married. It is usually required as someone proof or attestation of marital status.</p>
<h4>TYPES OF SINGLE STATUS CERTIFICATES</h4>
<p>There are two types of single status certificates that can be obtained. There is the certificate of bachelorhood and the certificate of spinsterhood, which applies to men and women respectively but serve the same purpose which is to indicate that a person is free to marry because he or she is not married at the moment, or his or her spouse is deceased or they have obtained a divorce decree where there was any previous marriage.</p>
<h4>WHY IS SINGLE STATUS CERTIFICATE REQUIRED?</h4>
<p>A single status certificate is required to show that a person is free to get married. It is usually required by people who want to get married outside jurisdiction i.e Nigeria, showing that the Marriage Registry, for instance, does not have any record of the person being married.</p>
<h4>OBTAINING SINGLE STATUS CERTIFICATE FOR FOREIGN USAGE</h4>
<p>The first step for obtaining a single status certificate for oversea usage is to firstly depose to an affidavit of Spinsterhood or Bachelorhood. After the affidavit has been deposed to, it is to be taken together with any other required documents to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Abuja for <a href="https://lawcarenigeria.com/document-attestation-from-ministry-of-foreign-affairs/">attestation.</a></p>
<h4>REQUIREMENTS FOR ATTESTATION MARITAL STATUS</h4>
<p>Documents required to obtain single status certificate include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Means of identification such as the National Identity card or international passport</li>
<li>For a divorcee, proof that the divorce has been completed.</li>
<li>If the person is a widow or a widower, the death certificate of the deceased spouse and also the Marriage certificate</li>
<li>Evidence of the place of residence of the applicant</li>
<li>Proof of change of name where relevant</li>
<li>Certificate of birth</li>
<li>Affidavit</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><u>CONCLUSION</u></strong></h4>
<p>A single status certificate is in form of an affidavit that will usually state the name, address, age, date of birth, citizenship, occupation, that the person is single and has never gone through a marriage ceremony before; or that his former spouse is dead; or that he is divorced if a divorce has taken place.</p>
<p>This single status certificate is always in the form of an affidavit, and it attests to the fact that the bearer or deponent does not have any existing marital obligation. It serves the same purpose a marriage certificate will serve for a married person to a single person.</p>
<p>Where a single certificate is to be used outside Nigeria for any purpose, such a document must be authenticated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>ATTESTATION OF DEGREE CERTIFICATE</strong></h3>
<p>There are several reasons why anyone would want to legalize a certificate or any other documents. Attestation of documents in Nigeria is usually required for documents, which are required to be used for any official or private purpose abroad.</p>
<p>Documents that are issued either by the Local, State or Federal Governments or any other government agency such as birth certificates, marriage certificates, certificates of incorporation, educational degree certificates, transcripts, death certificates, and so on, may be required to be authenticated and legalized before they can be used in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Normally, what is expected of an individual by the foreign establishments is to certify that the document, which is borne by such person is an authentic and valid one, and not forged.</p>
<p><strong>Process Involved in Attestation of a Certificate or Document in Nigeria</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before the attestation of a certificate or document, a qualified Notary Public must first <a href="https://lawcarenigeria.com/how-to-notarize-a-document-in-nigeria/">notarize such a document</a>. This must be done before any authentication takes place at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Qualified lawyers always carry out the notarization of documents. It should be noted that the charge for notarization is not fixed, it depends on one’s bargaining power.</li>
<li>After the notarization has been concluded, the document would be brought to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, upon which one would be required to authenticate the document.</li>
<li>There will be a required payment to be made for the certificate that is sought to be authenticated. The prescribed fee would be paid into the Ministry designated bank account.</li>
<li>Upon the completion of the payment, proof of payment (which is normally the bank teller or online payment slip) would be submitted at the Legal Services Department in the Ministry. The applicant may be asked to return to the embassy within a few days to pick up the authenticated documents.</li>
<li>If the document involved is an academic certificate or transcript, the document must also be attested at the Federal Ministry of Education, where the applicant can either apply himself or through a lawful attorney only.</li>
<li>After the authentication process, the document may be taken to the relevant embassy for legalization where such a process is further required.</li>
</ul>
<p>In closing, it should be noted that there are different documents that can be legalized, but the step for attestation of various documents are often similar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LEGAL RETAINER IN NIGERIA</strong></p>



<p>Legal Retainership can be defined as a contractual relationship between a hired lawyer and a client (Individual or Corporation) specifying the nature of the services to be rendered and the cost for rendering such services. Retainership may involve managing a cause, instituting or defending an action, or performing general legal services on behalf of a client.</p>



<p>Generally, it is common for the services of a lawyer can be employed by an individual or a Corporate body for professional legal services to be rendered for a particular purpose. A legal retainer means that a client employs the legal services of a lawyer for a period of time with the payment of a fee called <strong>Retainer fee. </strong>In return, the lawyer provides some legal services</p>



<p>A retainer fee is an advanced payment that is made by an individual or corporate client to a lawyer, which is usually considered as a down payment on future services to be rendered by a lawyer.</p>



<p>Retainership is oftentimes useful for individuals or corporations that need constant legal services. For example, if a lawyer is hired for the purpose of litigation, the lawyer will be authorized to accept service of documents and act on behalf of the client.</p>



<p>When a lawyer is employed on a legal retainer by a client, the client prevents the attorney from acting on behalf of an adverse party.</p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The major types of legal retainership</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Litigation Retainer</strong>: A lawyer can be retained to act on behalf of a client in litigation matters by going to Court to defend or institute an action for a client or perform on a full-time or part-time basis, services relating to Court matters. This type of service cannot be rendered on a fixed or annual retainer fee but on<em> quantum-merui</em>t<em>.</em></li>
<li><strong>Retainership for property management</strong>: for instance, a lawyer can be retained by a client who is a landlord to collect rent from tenants, evict defaulting tenants, or institute actions in court from any malicious act that arises in course of managing the property.</li>
<li><strong>Company Secretary and Legal Representative &amp; Advisor:</strong> this is the most common type of retainership. It is strictly between lawyers and corporate entities. A company may engage the services of a lawyer to act as its company secretary and legal representative for a fixed annual fee, payable on monthly or quarterly installments. A lawyer on this type of retainership shall engage or perform all statutory and administrative functions of a company secretary among some other legal services on behalf of companies. A company seeking to engage a  lawyer for a legal retainership should contact lawyers in Nigeria to discuss the appropriate legal fees.</li>
</ul>



<p>Commonly, in matters that involve extensive legal professional work, there will be a retainer agreement signed by the lawyer and the client. The agreement contains the nature of services to be performed by the lawyer, the retainer fee charged, and the tenure of the retainer relationship.</p>



<p>Furthermore, an additional payment of fees may be required where the time spent on the task or service increases, especially where such retainership involves litigation. This is based upon the volume of work done by the lawyer on a retainership. Also, a lawyer on retainership may charge the client additional where the professional legal task to be performed is not included in the retainership agreement.</p>



<p>In conclusion, a legal retainership is a work for hire relationship, which is either on a full-time or part-time basis. The purpose is for the performance of services that defines the terms of the working relationship.</p>
