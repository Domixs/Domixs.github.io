										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <strong><a href="http://cbn.gov.ng/">Central Bank of Nigeria</a></strong> says it has ended the sales of forex to Bureau De Change operators, saying the parallel market has become a conduit for illicit forex flows and graft.</p>
<p>The bank said it will also no longer process applications for BDC licences in the country.</p>
<p>Weekly sales of foreign exchange by the CBN will henceforth go directly to commercial banks, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, said Tuesday in a live TV broadcast after announcing that the bank has retained its benchmark policy rate.</p>
<p>“We are concerned that BDCs have allowed themselves to be used for graft,” Mr Emefiele said,.</p>
<p>He said international bodies, including some embassies and donor agencies, have been complicit in illegal forex transactions that have hindered the flow of foreign exchange into the country.</p>
<p>He said the organisations have chosen to channel forex through the black market than use the official Investors and Exporters (I&amp;E) window, called Nafex.</p>
<p>Mr Emefiele said the regulator will “deal ruthlessly” with banks allowing illegal forex dealers to use their platforms and will report the defaulting international organisations to their regulators.</p>
<p>“We will deal with them ruthlessly and we will report the international bodies,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Sales to Nigerians</strong></p>
<p>Accordingly, Mr Emefiele said banks are mandated to “immediately” and transparently sell forex to customers who present the required documents. All banks are to immeidtaely create dedicated tellers for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Cusromers not attended to by the banks are to report to the CBN through a toll free number: 0700 22 55 226 or email: cbd@cbn.gov.ng.</p>
<p>“This measure is not punitive on anyone, but it is to ensure the CBN is able to carry out its legitimate mandate of serving all Nigerians,” Mr Emefiele said.</p>
