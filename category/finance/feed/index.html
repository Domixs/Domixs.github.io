										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NHF CONTRIBUTIONS SCHEME IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>National Housing Funding (NHF) is a Federal Government scheme that entitles Nigerians in paid employment and above 21 years to cater to their housing needs. This scheme was established by the virtue of the NHF Act of 1992.</p>
<p>According to the NHF Act, all Nigerian employees and income earners, whether in paid employment or self-employment, are entitled to the NHF scheme and can register as long as they are 21 years of age. The Act also outlines that registered members should contribute about 2.5% of their basic monthly salary to the Fund through the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN).</p>
<h4><strong>Is NHF compulsory? </strong></h4>
<p>As per the provisions in the NHF Act, all Nigerians in paid employment are obligated to contribute 2.5% of their monthly salary to the National House Fund. Consequently, an employer must deduct 2.5% of the basic salary from the employees and remit it to the FMBN monthly.</p>
<h4><strong>What are the benefits of the NHF scheme? </strong></h4>
<p>The main goal of the NHF scheme is the allocation of funds for the provision of affordable housing for Nigerians. Primarily, it allows a contributor to access a loan for the building, purchasing, or renovation loan for residential accommodation.</p>
<p>Among other benefits a contributor enjoys from the NHF scheme include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced tax liability because contributions to the NHF are tax-deductible</li>
<li>Housing loan of up to 90% of the cost of the house.</li>
<li>Interest on loans remains fixed throughout the life of the mortgage at 6% p.a.</li>
<li>The long period of repayment of up to 30 years.</li>
<li>Contributions can serve as additional old age security.</li>
<li>Up to N15 million can be borrowed.</li>
<li>Refunds with 2% interest on retirement.</li>
<li>Every contributor has a lifetime registration number, a passbook for the personal recording of contributions and an account statement.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the penalty for not contributing to NHF? </strong></h4>
<p><strong>Section 20</strong> of the Act stipulates that Punishments vary depending on the party, as outlined below:</p>
<ol>
<li>A person who prevents or obstructs deduction or remittance of the contribution is guilty under Sec 20 of the Act, guilty of an offence, and liable to a fine of N5, 000 or one-year imprisonment.</li>
<li>An employer who fails to make deductions from his employees&#8217; salaries for NHF contribution or fails to remit the money deducted is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of N50, 000. Also, the individual staff of the employer responsible for making a deduction or remit deduction is exposed to a fine of N20, 000 or imprisonment for five years term or both such fine and imprisonment.</li>
<li>A self-employed person who fails to make a deduction and fails to remit to the bank money for the NHF is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of N5 000 or one-year imprisonment, or both.</li>
</ol>
<p>The institution of proceedings or imposition of a penalty under this section shall not relieve any employer or self-employed person from liability to pay to the bank the money deducted by him for the purpose of the Fund.</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE FOR REGISTRATION WITH NHF</strong></p>
<p>All Nigerians in employment, whether self-employed or in paid employment, are required by the NHF Act to contribute 2.5% of their basic salary/income to the fund. The procedure for registration is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) will supply Employer Registration       Form (NHF1) to employers.</li>
<li>Employers will complete form NHF1 and return to the nearest branch of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria will register the Employer and issue an employer’s registration number.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria will issue form NHF2 to employers for completion by employees or directly to self-employed or individuals.</li>
<li>An employee will complete the form NHF2 and return it to the employer.</li>
<li>The employer or self-employed individuals will return the completed form (NHF2) to the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria will register Employees on Form NHF2 and allocate employees&#8217; participation numbers to each employee/self-employed individual.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank will issue a passbook to each of the registered employees where the monthly deduction of his/her 2.5% basic salary will be posted by the employer.</li>
<li>At this point, an employee is now a registered participant of the National Housing Fund.</li>
<li>Employer will commence the deduction of contributions at source. Such deductions/contributions are remitted to the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria with a schedule of payment indicating the amount contributed by each employee and the period covered.</li>
<li>Self–employed contributors will also commence monthly remittances of contributions to FMBN.</li>
<li>Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria will accept contributions and issue receipts for payments.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How does one apply for an NHF loan? </strong></h4>
<p>First, the applicant must meet the eligibility requirements on the loan application form, including registering with the NHF scheme. The applicant must be someone who contributed to the Fund at least six months before applying for the loan. Unlike institutional borrowers, individuals cannot apply directly from the FMBN but through a duly licensed and accredited Primary Mortgage Institution (PMI) of their choice. The PMI then forwards the application to the FMBN.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>At its inception, the major goal of NHF was affordable housing to accommodate the Nigerian populace in a suitable environment as the performance of the housing sector is one of the yardsticks for measuring the health of a nation.</p>
<p>Nigeria’s property market faces a paucity of funds, thus a law that mandates every employee to contribute a part of their earnings towards owning a home is important.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, the demand for affordable and befitting housing for citizens far outweighs its supply. NHF, therefore, serves as a contribution towards acquiring an asset, in this case, a home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> Advantages of eNaira</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Central Bank Launches E-Currency in Nigeria </strong></p>
<p>The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has told financial institutions in the country that <strong><a href="https://enaira.com/">eNaira</a></strong> is not a subtle scheme to take away bank customers. It said the plan is to grant access to more financially excluded people.</p>
<p>The regulator said this in details published on the website of the country’s digital currency which went live on Monday ahead of its launch on October 1.</p>
<p>It said the eNaira opens up a whole new market of digital currency users for financial institutions to increase their customer base and add value to their account owners.</p>
<p>The bank provided details of how the digital currency will affect individuals, businesses, governments and nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p>The following are the CBN explanations in respect of the eNaira’s advantages:</p>
<p><strong>Financial institutions</strong></p>
<p>“Integral to the establishment of eNaira is the necessity to build more synergy with financial institutions. The framework of eNaira is such that it entrenches many pipelines of collaboration and further strengthens financial institutions core service delivery. By its very nature with regards to its mandates, eNaira enhances the structures of these institutions instead of replacing same.</p>
<p>“eNaira opens up a whole new market of digital currency users for financial institutions to increase their customer base and add value to their account owners.</p>
<p>“Financial Institutions act as bridges between customers and the CBN, this increased customer interaction can help them adopt better customer support models.</p>
<p>“eNaira is not a subtle scheme to steal your customers. It is a collaboration to grant access to more financially excluded people.</p>
<p>“eNaira gives every linked financial institution access to the database of customers with wallets domiciled in their banks.</p>
<p>“eNaira Maximum Daily Cumulative Limit restricts customers from total migration which result in a capital loss for financial institutions.</p>
<p>“The eNaira system is designed and integrated with the best fraud management system, which guarantees the security of transactions and fosters customers’ trust”.</p>
<p><strong>Individuals</strong></p>
<p>“For individuals, eNaira promises fast transactions, cheap diaspora remittance, direct government aids, easier local payment, and secure banking.</p>
<p>“eNaira was minted with your expectations in mind. We understand our customers are real people whose needs are constantly evolving so our approach to delivering tailored solutions needs to constantly evolve. From functionality, call to action, to user interface, our goal has always been to deliver an exceptional digital experience tailored to your needs.</p>
<p>“eNaira makes diaspora payments cheap and safe to ensure you get more value for every Naira you earn.</p>
<p>“Financial Government Aids gets straight to you. eNaira knocks the middlemen out the way and you can claim funds directly.</p>
<p>“The faster, the better. eNaira makes it possible to send funds, save money, and save time while at it.</p>
<p>“Boycott the queues and pay taxes, and bills from the comfort of your home. It’s easier and it’s dependable</p>
<p>“Worried about the safety and security of banking details? Rest assured; the transparency makes everything traceable.</p>
<p>“Now there’s enough room for everyone to enjoy banking services. The process is easy and the process is simple.</p>
<p><strong>Government </strong></p>
<p>“Through a reduction in cash handling costs and more transparent taxing systems, eNaira makes more funds available for development projects such as better feeder roads, affordable education, and more equipped health facilities. Spending eNaira, will make for richer Government and richer people.</p>
<p>“eNaira creates easy access to financial services at remote areas that have suffered financial exclusion for years</p>
<p>“With eNaira, tax evasion is history because eNaira ensures the traceability of taxable assets and enforces transparency in the taxation systems thereby increasing revenue.</p>
<p>“eNaira enables the government to send direct welfare allowance to citizens and communities that are beneficiaries of such interventions.</p>
<p>“eNaira facilitates instant cross-border foreign exchange which boosts the economic growth of the nation.</p>
<p>“eNaira greatly reduces the costs of handling cash, from minting all the way to destruction, the Federal government saves cost</p>
<p>“eNaira minimizes fraudulent activities and shady deals such as money laundering, and illegal money deals because of the trackable unique ID of each eNaira.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Governmental Organisations</strong></p>
<p>“The transparent nature of the currency also benefits Non-Governmental Organisations, donations can be made easily, and easy tracking of usage.</p>
<p>“eNaira offers local and international Non-Governmental Organizations and Religious Institutions money transaction solutions that ensure that, at the end of the day, their focus is trained more on carrying out their projects than on the security and usage of the money backing each project. This is because the confidence that the money will do exactly what it was purposed to do, even faster, cheaper, and safer than previously obtainable is what eNaira offers.</p>
<p>“International NGOs can now send and receive donations and contributions across countries with a faster, easier, cheaper, and safer method than previously obtainable, without the old hassles of rigorous money transfer bottlenecks.</p>
<p>“Community and Aid project beneficiaries do not have to wait so long to receive what has been promised them anymore. Once the beneficiary owns an eNaira wallet, all aid goes straight from the wallet of the NGO to the wallet of the beneficiary in seconds.</p>
<p>“Religious institutions now have a cleaner and more direct means of gathering collections by members, eliminating the costs and risks of cash handling.</p>
<p>“Micro-donations are now so much more possible for welfare projects, whereby, denominational limits are not placed on what can be donated, giving all cadres of donors a chance to give in situations where “looking for transaction balances” would have deterred them.</p>
<p>“Expense-tracking and report-development for social projects for NGOs have become nearly automated with eNaira, as the traceability of each eNaira ensures that balancing ledgers and knowing the exact identity of the recipient of each eNaira occurs at near-real-time and in tandem with the very transfer of funds itself.</p>
<p>“NGOs and Religious institutions do not have to worry about cases where hired project managers abscond with money set aside for welfare projects when they use eNaira, as forgery and counterfeiting of eNaira units is impossible due to its unique identity and the fortified security backing its Distributed Ledger System.”</p>
<p><strong>Businesses</strong></p>
<p>For businesses, eNaira promises to help customers pay for their services with ease.</p>
<p>“eNaira helps your customers pay for your services with such ease that keeps them coming back. With eNaira, your customer base spreads beyond the shores of Nigeria because overseas payment is not just possible but fast and even cheap. The more the patronage, the more profit!</p>
<p>“eNaira makes it easier for you to get support allowance from the government because the CBN has your wallet information and can make direct deposits on behalf of the government.</p>
<p>“eNaira gives your customers a super-easy payment option through its QR Code Scan feature and it makes them keep coming back.</p>
<p>“eNaira promotes efficient and straightforward cross-border payments which foster profitable foreign business partnerships.</p>
<p>“eNaira peer-to-peer payment feature facilitates a boost in eCommerce and gives the in-mall experience to friends physically separated by distance.</p>
<p>“eNaira opens up a whole new customer base you did not know existed, with the increased customers, business growth is guaranteed.</p>
<p>“With eNaira businesses can easily make sales in any country because the eNaira is 100percent local and 100percent global,” according to the CBN</p>

A trustee is usually hired by an issuer to oversee the implementation of a bond between the bond issuer and a bondholder.</p>
<p><strong>Functions</strong></p>
<p>The functions of trustees shall be as follows:-</p>
<p><strong>In respect of collective investment scheme: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Monitoring of the activities of the fund manager and custodian on behalf of and in the interest of unit holders or fund contributors;</li>

<li>Hold and administer sinking funds where applicable.</li>
<li>Monitor the register of bonds/unit holders.</li>
<li>Perform all other functions stipulated in the requisite trust deed, ISA, CAMA,TIA and other legislations.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Registration requirements</strong></p>
<p>Below are the registration requirements of a Trustee as stipulated by Rule 109 of SEC, 2013;</p>
<p>(1) An application for registration as trustee shall be filed on Form S.E.C. 4A and shall be accompanied by-;</p>
<p>(a) a minimum of two (2) sets of completed Form S.E.C. 2 to be filed by the sponsored individuals;</p>

<p>(3) Rule 83 (3) and (4) shall, with all necessary modifications, apply in case of denial or suspension of registration of a trustee.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>The involvement of the trustee in the capital market fosters a contractual relationship between the Issuer, Trustee and Investor. It is therefore expedient that a trustee ensures that the SEC approval is duly obtained and diligent care is taken as the capital market can be full of risks.</p>
