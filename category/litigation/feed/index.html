										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Appealing a judgment is simply to invite a higher Court than the Court that adjudicated and gave judgment on a matter, to find out whether the lower Court arrived at a correct decision after evaluating and considering the facts before it and the applicable laws. This article seeks to give an overview of appeal and how to appeal a judgment in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Appeals involve proceeding from the judgment of a trial court to an appellate Court or from one appellate Court to another appellate Court. Appeals are important because it affords a litigant who is not satisfied with a judgment or who judgment was not in favour of to file an appeal and also there is a realization that judges are human and they can be wrong in their judgments. Thus, appeal creates an opportunity to give another set of judges the right to assess the decision of a lower judge. A party who files an appeal is called an <strong>Appellant </strong>and the party whom it is filed against is called the <strong>Respondent</strong>.</p>
<p>The laws applicable to appeals in Nigeria are; the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), the Court of Appeal Act, and the Court of Appeal Rule 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Party to an Appeal matter</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 243(1) (a)</strong> of the 1999 Constitution provides for only two (2) categories of persons who can exercise the right of appeal in civil cases. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any party on record, which is the party to the proceeding whose name appears on the process.</li>
<li>Any non-party interested in the matter with leave of the trial Court or Court of Appeal. In this instance, where a party claims to be an interested party, he must show that his interest is affected by the decision he wants to appeal against. Failure to obtain leave of Court before appealing as a non-party having an interest in the matter renders the appeal incompetent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Right to file an Appeal in Nigeria</strong></p>
<p>The right of a litigant to file an appeal at the appellate Court is divided into two categories which will be briefly discussed, namely;</p>
<ul>
<li>Appeal as of Right, and,</li>
<li>Appeal with the leave of Court (that is with the leave or consent of either the lower or appellate Court).</li>
</ul>
<p>Appeal as of Right</p>
<p>It is important to know the instances to file an appeal as of right because the processes to file at the appellate Court depends on whether the appeal is as of right or with the leave of the Court. The following are the instances of filing an appeal as of right in civil matters which does not require the leave of Court as provided by <strong>Section 241(1)(a)-(f)</strong> of the 1999 Constitution exclusive of paragraph (e) which applies to applies only criminal matters. These instances are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final decisions in any civil or criminal proceedings before the Federal High Court, High Court (state or FCT), and National Industrial Court sitting at first instance. The decision must be final and the Court must have sat as a Court of first instance in the case.</li>
<li>Where the ground of appeal involves questions of law alone arising from any civil or criminal proceeding. It is immaterial whether the decision was final or not.</li>
<li>Decisions on interpretation or application of the 1999 Constitution.</li>
<li>Decisions as to whether any provisions of Chapter IV of the 1999 Constitution has been, is being, or is likely to be contravened in relation to any person.</li>
<li>Decisions where the liberty of a person is concerned or the custody of an infant.</li>
<li>Where an injunction is granted or refused.</li>
<li>Where the appointment of a receiver is granted or refused.</li>
<li>Decision determining the case of a creditor or the liability of a contributory or other officers under any enactment relating to companies.</li>
<li>In the case of a decree nisi in a matrimonial cause.</li>
<li>A decision in an admiralty action determining liability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Appeal with the Leave of the Court</p>
<p>In this case, the right of appeal is not as of right, but can only be exercised by leave of Court. The leave required here is the leave of either the trial Court or the Court of Appeal. That is, the leave must be that of the Federal High Court, State High Court, High Court FCT, National Industrial Court (depending on which one handled the case), or that of the Court of Appeal. Where the right to file an appeal is by leave of Court, the power of a judge to grant leave to appeal is discretionary.</p>
<p>The instances for filing an appeal with the leave of the Court are provided in <strong>Section 241</strong> of the 1999 Constitution as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>Matters not coming under section 241(1) CFRN, appeal in such cases requires the leave of Court.</li>
<li>When consent judgment is given by the Court.</li>
<li>Filing an appeal as to cost only. Award or non-award of cost.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commencement of an Appeal</strong></p>
<p>The appropriate time to commence and file an appeal for an interlocutory decision is within fourteen (14) days after the decision as provided by <strong>Section 24(2)(a</strong>) Court of Appeal Act and in the case of a final judgment, the appropriate time to file an appeal is within 3 months after the judgment was delivered.</p>
<p>Where a party is out of time to file an appeal, he can file an application for an extension of time to seek the leave of the Court of Appeal. Only the Court of Appeal is empowered to extend the time for filing an appeal and not the High Court (trial Court) as provided by <strong>Order 7 Rule 10</strong> of the Court of Appeal Rules 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure for application for Leave to Appeal </strong></p>
<p>By the provisions of <strong>Order 7 Rule 4</strong> of the Court of Appeal Rules 2011, application for leave to appeal must first be made to the lower Court (High Court or Federal High Court) whose decision is being appealed against except if there are special circumstances which makes it impossible or impracticable to apply to the lower Court. In such cases, the application may then be made first to the Court of appeal.</p>
<p>The application to the lower Court is usually by a Motion Ex parte. However, the Court may order that the other party be served or may grant or refuse the application.</p>
<p>Where the application for leave to appeal is refused by the lower Court, then by the provisions of <strong>Order 7 Rule 3</strong> of the Court of Appeal Rules 2011, a similar application may be made to the Court of Appeal within fifteen (15) days of such refusal by the lower Court.</p>
<p>By <strong>Order 7 Rule 2 </strong>of the Court of Appeal Rules 2011, an application to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal, other than an application made after the expiration of the time for appealing, shall be by Motion on Notice, which must be served on all the affected parties.</p>
<p>By the provisions of <strong>Order 7 Rule 7</strong> of the Court of Appeal Rules 2011, the application shall consist of the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motion on Notice (Civil Form 5).</li>
<li>Certified True Copy of the decision of the lower Court sought to be appealed against.</li>
<li>Certified True Copy of proposed grounds of appeal.</li>
<li>Where leave has been refused by the lower Court, then a Certified True Copy of the Order or ruling refusing leave to appeal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notice of Appeal</strong></p>
<p>An appeal is lodged in the Court of Appeal by means of a <strong>Notice of Appeal.</strong> The Notice of Appeal, though headed in the name of the Court of Appeal, is filed in the Registry of the High Court or Federal High Court, or National Industrial Court that gave the decision appealed against. By the provisions of <strong>Order 6 Rule 2(1)</strong> of the Court of Appeal Rules, it must contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of the decision complained against. It must state whether it is the whole or only part of the decision of the lower Court is complained against. Where the complaint is against only a part of the decision of the lower Court, the relevant part must be specified.</li>
<li>The grounds of appeal and particulars of error- A ground of an appeal is a complaint on an issue of fact or law or procedure which if upheld will lead to the appeal being allowed. It must be valid and raise serious questions to be considered on appeal. The grounds of appeal are not considered alone, particulars must be supplied along with it. Reliefs sought: It must also state the exact nature of the reliefs</li>
<li>Persons interested in the appeal: the names and addresses of all the parties affected by the appeal.</li>
<li>It must have an address for service</li>
</ul>
<p>By the provisions of <strong>Order 6 Rule 2(3) </strong>Court of Appeal Rules, 2011, a Notice of Appeal should set forth concisely and under distinct heads, the grounds of appeal which the appellant intends to rely on at the hearing of the appeal without any argument or narrative and shall be numbered consecutively.</p>
<p>After the Notice of appeal has been filed, the Registrar will serve a true copy of the notice on each person mentioned in the notice within thirty (30) days after receiving service of the notice of appeal.</p>
<p><strong>The Effect of Filing an Appeal</strong></p>
<p>The effect of filing an appeal is provided by <strong>Order 4 Rule 11</strong> of the Court of Appeal Rules to, the effect that <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>after an appeal has been entered and until it has been finally disposed of, the Court of Appeal shall be seized of the whole proceedings as between the parties thereto and except as may be otherwise provided by the Court of Appeal Rules, every application made in the proceedings shall be made to the Court of appeal and not the trial Court</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Record of Appeal </strong></p>
<p>Once an appellant or an interested party has filed a Notice of Appeal, the Registrar of the lower Court is required to compile the record of appeal and transmit it to the registrar of the Court of Appeal within 60 days after its filing as provided by <strong>Order 8 Rule 1</strong> of the Court of Appeal Rules.</p>
<p>The record of appeal is the entire document necessary for the determination of the appeal at the Court of appeal. If the Registrar of the lower Court fails to within 60 days compile the record of appeal, the appellant is to compile the records of all documents and exhibits necessary to his appeal and transmit same to the Court of Appeal within 30 days as provided by <strong>Order 8 Rule 4</strong> of the Court of Appeal Rules.</p>
<p>Where both Registrar of lower Court and appellant failed to compile the records and transmit same, the respondent may by notice of motion move the Court to dismiss the appeal as provided by <strong>Order 8 Rule 18</strong>. An appeal is entered when the record of appeal has been transmitted to, received, and entered in the cause book of the Court of Appeal and when an appeal has been entered, the lower Court ceases to have jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>Respondent’s Notice</strong></p>
<p>A respondent who agrees with the decision of the trial court, which is in his favour, but who also wishes can urge the Court of Appeal that the judgment should be affirmed or varied on other grounds other than those relied on by the trial judge in reaching the decision. To achieve this, the respondent is required to file a <strong>Respondent’s Notice</strong> in Praecipe Form 10 B. The notice must specify the grounds for the contention and the precise form of variations which he proposes the Court of appeal to make as provided by Order 9 Rule 1 &amp; 2 of the Court of Appeal Rules.</p>
<p>By the provisions of <strong>Order 9 Rule 4</strong> of the Court of Appeal Rules, where it is an appeal against an interlocutory decision, the respondent’s notice must be filed and served on all parties to the proceedings in the High Court who are directly affected by the Respondent’s contention, within fifteen (15) days of the service of the Notice of Appeal on the respondent and where it is a final judgment, the respondent’s notice must be so served within thirty (30) days of the service of the Notice of Appeal on the respondent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, where the respondent fails to file the respondent’s notice, <strong>Order 9 Rule 3</strong> of the Court of Appeal Rules provides that he will not be heard praying for a variation or affirmation of the decision on grounds other than those relied on by the trial Court, except by leave of the Court of appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>The above gives a clear overview of how to appeal a judgment in Nigeria and the various procedures to be considered and followed for the filing of the appeal to succeed.</p>
<p>Finally, every appeal is heard by way of a rehearing as provided by <strong>Order 6 Rule 2(1)</strong> of the Court of Appeal Rules. A re-hearing is simply the reconsideration of the case on the printed evidence and not a re-trial and in appeals, the appellate court will not set aside or interfere with findings of fact of the trial court except if it is so perverse and not supported by the evidence admitted and on the record as held in the case of <em><strong>Onukogu v. Onuigbo &amp; Ors (2015) LPELR-24574(CA).</strong></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The jurisdiction of the Federal High Court is enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), which provides for the judiciary arm of Government (the Courts). <strong>Section 249 (1)</strong> of the Constitution created the Federal High Court, which is the third-highest court in the hierarchy of courts in Nigeria. The Federal High Court Act 1973 regulates and governs matters relating to the court.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the Federal High Court is the inherent power and extent of the powers of the Federal High Court to determine a civil and criminal proceeding instituted before it. The jurisdiction of the court is provided in <strong>Section 251</strong> of the Constitution, which will be highlighted below.</p>
<p><strong>Structure and Organization</strong></p>
<p>The Federal High Court is composed of the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court and any number of Judges of the Federal High Court as may be prescribed by the Act of National Assembly as stated in <strong>Section 249</strong> of the Constitution. The Federal High Court Act provides that the Federal High Court shall consist of the Chief Judge and fifty (50) Judges of the Court.</p>
<p>The appointment of a person to the office of the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court is made by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council (NJC), subject to the confirmation of the Senate as provided in <strong>Section 250</strong> of the Constitution. The appointments of Judges are made by the President on the recommendation of the NJC.</p>
<p>The Constitution further states that a person will not be qualified to hold the office of the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court unless he is a qualified legal practitioner for not less than ten (10) years.</p>
<p><strong>Jurisdiction of the Federal High Court</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 251(1)</strong> of the Constitution highlights the powers of the Federal High Court to determine legal matters and the extent of these powers as conferred by the Constitution and the Act of the National Assembly. The section provides that <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an Act of the National Assembly, the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other court in civil cases and matters-</em></strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><em>s. such other jurisdiction civil or criminal and whether to the exclusion of any other court or not as may be conferred upon it by an Act of the National Assembly”.</em></strong></p>
<p>The Federal High Court also has jurisdiction and powers in respect of treason, treasonable felony, and allied offenses as stated in <strong>Section 251(2).</strong> It also exercises jurisdiction and powers in respect of criminal causes and matters in respect of all matters listed above in section 251(1) of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The National Assembly may also by law make provisions to confer upon the Federal High Court additional powers as may appear necessary or desirable for enabling the Court more effectively to exercise its jurisdiction. The various legislations, which have conferred or widened the jurisdictions of the Federal High Court among others include the Federal High Court Act; Copyright Act; Trade Marks Act; Admiralty Jurisdiction Act; Companies and Allied Matters Act; and Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act.</p>
<p>With respect to the constitution of the Federal High Court to have jurisdiction to determine a matter, <strong>Section 253 </strong>of the Constitution provides that <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>the Federal High Court</em></strong> <strong><em>shall be duly constituted if it consists of at least one Judge of the Court</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The Federal High Court is a superior court of record in Nigeria and it has coordinate jurisdiction with the High Courts of various states of the Federation as conferred upon it by the provisions of the Constitution. Although the Federal High Court has various judicial divisions across many states in Nigeria, it is considered a single court.</p>

<div class="column">
<p>Malicious prosecution could be defined as a tort arising from unsuccessful criminal or civil proceedings instituted against another party with malice and without probable or reasonable cause. It is also defined as the tort of initiating criminal prosecution or civil suit against another party with malice and without probable cause. Where any person has been maliciously prosecuted, such person may bring an action in tort seeking damages against the accusers. The case of <strong>OGBONNA v. OGBONNA &amp; ANOR (2014) LPELR-22308(CA) </strong>was instructive on it.</p>
<p>Malicious prosecutions are outright abuse of process and usually damage to the character, person, liberty, property or finance. In the circumstance, the Plaintiff would have illegitimately used the coercive powers of the state to cause harm to another, the Defendant and the coercive powers of the state are, thus, also abused.</p>
<p>For a claimant to succeed in an action for malicious prosecution, he or she must plead and prove the followings;</p>
<ol>
<li>The prosecution proceedings (normally criminal) were initiated by the prosecutor against the plaintiff;</li>
<li>Termination of the prosecution proceedings was in the plaintiff&#8217;s favour;</li>
<li>No reasonable or probable cause for the prosecution;</li>
<li>Evidence of malice on the prosecutor&#8217;s part; and</li>
<li>That the plaintiff suffered actual damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the case of <strong>EJIKEME V. NWOSU (2002) 3 NWLR (Pt. 754) 356; (2001) LPELR CA/J/76/94</strong></p>
<p>The onus is on the plaintiff to prove each of the elements stated above.</p>
<p><strong>PROCEEDING WAS INSTITUTED BY THE DEFENDANT</strong></p>
<p>For the claim for malicious prosecution, to be liable, a defendant must be actively instrumental in setting the law in motion for the prosecution of the plaintiff.”</p>
<p><strong>In the words of ELECHI  J.C.A  </strong>in <strong>ADEBOWALE v. ROBINSON (2018) LPELR-44424(CA), </strong>” <strong><em>an action for malicious prosecution will not lie against a person who merely gave an information to the police by a report or complaint of the commission of an offence which led the police on their own initiative to arrest, and eventually charge another to Court after their investigation of the complaint</em></strong>” see also the case of  <strong>INNEH V. ARUEGBON (1952) 14 WACA 73,</strong></p>
<p>Thus, If the evidence did not show that the defendant influenced the police in any way in the decision to prosecute a plaintiff, then the prosecution cannot and will not properly be attributable to the defendant, but the police.</p>
<p>Witnesses are immune from an action in malicious prosecution even if they lie on the witness box. This is because an action for malicious prosecution focuses on the abuse of the legal process, not on defamatory or untruthful statements.</p>
<p><strong>TERMINATION OF THE PROSECUTION PROCEEDINGS WAS IN THE PLAINTIFF&#8217;S FAVOUR;</strong></p>
<p>The action for Malicious prosecution will fail if the criminal proceeding was not determined in favour of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>In <strong>FADEYI &amp; ANOR V. OWOLABI &amp; ANOR (2014) LPELR- 22475 (CA),</strong> where the Appellants were discharged and acquitted on the count at the trial court. The Court of Appeal held that for an action on malicious prosecution to fail, it should be shown that the trial ended in the conviction of the accused.</p>
<p>Where in the criminal proceeding instituted against the plaintiff, a <strong><em>nolle prosequi</em></strong> (prosecutor discontinues prosecution) is entered on behalf of the plaintiff, the plaintiff does not need to positively prove his innocence to recover damages for malicious prosecution as held in the case of  OGBONNA V. OGBONNA &amp;ANOR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROBABLE CAUSE </strong></p>
<p>The plaintiff must prove that there was no reasonable cause for the prosecution and was instituted for an improper purpose. See <strong>GARBA V. MAIGORO (1992) 5 NWLR (Pt.243) 588. </strong>It is however for the plaintiff to establish a lack of reasonable and probable cause not for the defendant to prove its existence.</p>
<p>A failure to fully investigate the facts surrounding a case may be sufficient to prove a lack of probable cause.</p>
<p><strong>DAMAGES</strong></p>
<p>The plaintiff must prove that by the prosecution against him he suffered damages either to his reputation, person or property. He must satisfy the court either that he was corporally punished or imprisoned or that he had been in jeopardy of such punishment or that he incurred cost in the course of the prosecution.</p>
<p>In Conclusion, malicious prosecution entails actions against a defendant who without reasonable or probable cause initiates criminal prosecution against the plaintiff which terminates in the plaintiff’s favour and which also results in damages either to the plaintiff’s reputation, person or property. A person suing for malicious prosecution must prove all of the above elements stipulated in the case <strong>EJIKEME V. NWOSU</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS IN NIGERIA </strong></p>
<p>All superior courts have a uniform procedure for enforcement governed by the Sheriffs and Civil Process Act. The Sheriffs and Civil Process Act, Judgment (Enforcement) Rules, and the Rules of Court collectively govern the enforcement of a judgment in Nigeria.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure for Enforcement of Judgment</strong></p>
<p>The procedure for enforcement will depend on whether the judgment is a Money or Non-money.</p>
<p><strong>MONEY JUDGMENT</strong></p>
<p>Money judgment can be enforced in one or more of the following ways; Writ of Fieri Facias, Garnishee proceedings, Judgment summons and Writ of sequestration.</p>
<p><strong>Writ of Fieri Facias</strong> &#8211; this is also known as Writ of Fi.Fa or writ of attachment and sale. This writ cannot be issued until after 3 days from the day the judgment was given except with leave of court. Conditions for issuing such writ of fi.fa are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Writ is first issued against the movable properties and then extended to an immovable property when the movable property is insufficient to satisfy the debt.</li>
<li>It is issued and directed at the movable properties, goods, and chattels, money, banknotes, bills of exchange, promissory notes, bonds, specialties, or securities for money belonging to the judgment debtor except his clothes, beddings, and his tools and implements of trade to the value of ten and that of his family.</li>
<li>Application is by filing Form 3 in the First Schedule to the Act.</li>
<li>Issuance and endorsement of the writ by the registrar.</li>
<li>Execution of the writ by the court sheriff</li>
<li>The movable property attached shall not be sold until after 5 days from seizure except perishable goods or by a written request from the judgment debtor, where he been arrested and detained, sales cannot be made until after 1month and 15 days’ notice must be given to him specifying the goods taken and intended to be sold and a purchaser acquire good title upon sale.</li>
<li>For writ against immovable properties, the application is by way of motion on notice, supported by an affidavit and written address. The affidavit must show what steps have been taken to enforce the judgment and with what effect, the sum now remains due and that there is no movable property of the judgment debtor sufficient to satisfy the debt.</li>
<li>The application can only be made to the High Court, a Magistrate Court cannot issue the writ against immovable properties and the writ is in Form 38.</li>
<li>The immovable property shall not be sold until after 15 days from the day it was attached.</li>
<li>Sales are always by public auction; the purchaser’s title is voidable for 21 days from the sale after which it becomes absolute where there is no application to set it aside.</li>
<li>Issuance of Certificate of Title by the court- any execution without Court order renders the attachment and subsequent sale null and void.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Garnishee Proceedings- </strong>a judgment creditor (garnishor) can use these proceedings to attach a debt due from a third party (garnishee) to the judgment debtor in satisfaction of the judgment debt. For any debt to be attachable, it must be due or accruing to the judgment debtor, the amount must be certain and the judgment debtor must have an immediate legal right to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Application is by motion ex-parte supported by an affidavit. Upon hearing, the Court may make an <em>Order Nisi</em> ordering the garnishee to disclose the amount standing to the credit of judgment debtor to the Court and appear to show cause why the order should not be made absolute to compel him to pay the debt over to the judgment creditor.</li>
<li>The Order shall be served on the judgment debtor and garnishee at least 14 days before the date fix for hearing.</li>
<li>The garnishee is to pay into court the amount within 8 days of service on him, after payment he is to depose to an affidavit of compliance, where he claims that the money of the judgment debtor is not in custody, he is to depose to an affidavit stating such fact.</li>
<li>Where he refuses to comply with the order or deny liability, the Court upon proof of service may order that execution be levied against him, or order trial, if found liable, then execution will be levied against him if otherwise, he will be discharged.</li>
<li>Where the money is in a public officer’s custody, there is a need for the consent of the Attorney General of the Federation or State before the Court can make an <em>Order Nisi. </em></li>
<li>After hearing, an order absolute would be made and the money will be transferred to the judgment creditor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judgment Summons</strong><strong> &#8211;</strong>This mode is usually resorted to where the judgment debtor has the means but has refused to pay,</p>
<ul>
<li>Application is by filing the praecipe in Form 13 for the issuance of a judgment summon, requiring the judgment debtor to appear and be examined as to his means. The summons can be either in Form 14 or 15.</li>
<li>If the judgment debtor refuses to attend Court or intends to abscond to avoid being examined on oath, the court may issue a warrant for his arrest and detention.</li>
<li>After investigation, the court may make any of the following orders: commit the judgment debtor to prison, order for the attachment of the judgment debtor’s property, order for payment in installments.</li>
<li>If committed to prison under a judgment summons, the judgment creditor is to pay for his sustenance to the tune of not more than 45kobo daily. If he fails to pay, the judgment debtor shall be released.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Writ of Sequestration</strong> &#8211; This writ directs sequestrators appointed by the court to enter the immovable property of the judgment debtor, collect and keep all rents and profits thereof and or seize and detain the movable properties of the judgment debtor until he obeys the judgment. The Writ does not vest title on the sequestrators.</p>
<p><strong>NON-MONEY JUDGMENT </strong></p>
<p>Judgments for recovery of land or delivery of possession except as between landlord and tenant is enforceable by Writ of Possession, while that between Landlord and tenant can be enforced by a Warrant of Possession. The writ can only be issued after 14 days from judgment, except otherwise ordered by the court. Judgment relating to the delivery of goods shall be enforced by a writ of Delivery in Form 67</p>
<p><strong>Procedure for enforcement of a judgment in another state </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apply and obtain a duly signed and sealed Certificate of Judgment.</li>
<li>Depose to an affidavit stating either of the following: that the amount has become due but unpaid or that an act ordered to be done remains undone or that the person ordered to forebear from doing an act has disobeyed the order.</li>
<li>Register the Certificate with the Registrar of a Court of similar jurisdiction in the state you intend to execute the judgment.</li>
<li>The Registrar of the enforcing court shall enter the particulars of the judgment in a book called “the Nigerian Register of Judgments”.</li>
<li>Upon registration, the judgment becomes a record of the court with the same effect as a judgment of that court, and the enforcing court can thereafter execute it.</li>
<li>After execution, the registrar of the enforcing court shall file a report of the outcome of the execution to the registrar of the court that gave the judgment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, it is worthy to note that the procedure for enforcement will depend on the type of judgment and that all writ of execution has a life span of one year from the date of issue. The judgment creditor has to follow the required procedure to avoid rendering the execution null and void.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS IN NIGERIA</strong></p>



<p>Fundamental rights are those rights that have been recognized and have constitutional backing in Nigeria, these rights are contained in chapter IV of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, as amended (CFRN, 1999). For the purpose of this discussion, our focus would be limited to chapter IV, CFRN 1999 and by extension, the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, and the Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure) Rules, 2009. The principal law governing the enforcement procedure for the enforcement of fundamental rights is the Fundamental Right (Enforcement Procedure) Rules 2009. Where the law is silent, the civil procedure rules of the court where the action is commenced shall be resorted to. Order 15 r 4 FR.</p>



<p><strong>Jurisdiction</strong></p>



<p>The court that has the jurisdiction to entertain a fundamental right enforcement suit is the court in the state where the infringement occurs or is likely to occur that is the Federal High Court and the High Court of a state or High Court of FCT. Order 1 r 2.  Note that there are certain instances where the National Industrial court will have jurisdiction as provided under Section 242(1) 1999 Constitution. The Federal High Court will have jurisdiction where the infringement arises from the original exclusive jurisdiction of the FHC as contained in section 251 of the 1999 Constitution or any other Act of National Assembly. The division of the Federal High Court must be the one where the infringement occurred and if there is no division, the one covering that state. See Section 46 CFRN 1999.</p>



<p><strong>Who can enforce fundamental rights?</strong></p>



<p>Infants through their guardian or next friend, Artificial bodies and associations acting in the interest of its members, any person including a foreigner in Nigeria, an action can also be brought by several people, but a deceased person cannot bring an action. Note however that where the action is for damages, the estate of the deceased can bring an action.</p>



<p><strong>Mode of commencing a fundamental right suit</strong></p>



<p>An application for enforcement of fundamental rights may be commerce by an originating process as accepted by the court without leave of court. Order 2 r 2 provides that leave of court is no longer required for bringing an application. Originating motion is most commonly used, the originating process shall be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief (s) sought, the grounds upon which the reliefs are sought supported by an Affidavit setting out the facts upon which the application is made – Order 2 r 3 and a written address in support of the grounds of the application. See Order 2 r 5 and <strong><em>Efcc Vs Akingbola (2015)</em></strong></p>



<p>Note that the affidavit can be deposed to by either the applicant himself or a person who has personal knowledge of the facts or by a person who was informed of the facts by the applicant where the applicant is in custody or is unable to swear to the affidavit. It must be clearly stated in the affidavit that the applicant is unable to depose to the affidavit personally- Order 2 r 4. Where a respondent intends to oppose the application based on grounds of law, he shall file his written address within 5 days of the service of the originating process on him. Order 2 r 6. The written address shall be accompanied by a counter-affidavit where he intends to depose to contrary facts, the applicant upon being served with the respondent written address may file and serve an address on points of law within 5 days on being served, the address may be accompanied with a further affidavit when new contrary facts arise in counter-affidavit. Order 2 r 7</p>



<p>Where the respondent intends to challenge the jurisdiction of the court, he is to file a notice of preliminary objection, counter-affidavit (where he is opposing facts), and written address Order 8 r 1 and 2. Where he does not file a counter-affidavit, he will be deemed to have admitted the facts in the applicant’s affidavit. order 8 r 3.</p>



<p>In light of the above, there would be two applications before the court. The court will hear both applications (the preliminary objection and substantive application).</p>



<p> The court can make either of the following orders; strike out the application for want of jurisdiction or set aside the service of the original application. Order 8 r 5 provides that where the court assumes jurisdiction, it will go ahead hear and give its ruling on the substantive application. – Order 8 r 6. Note that by virtue of the provisions of Order III, <a>an application for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights cannot be affected by any limitation of Statute, </a>the Public Officer Act inclusive, Order 3 r 1. This is to the effect that an application may be brought at any time notwithstanding the time the act constituting the breach was committed.</p>



<p><strong>Hearing of the proceedings</strong></p>



<p>By virtue of Order IV, the hearing of the application shall be fixed within 7 days from the day the application was filed and the hearing of the application may from time to time be adjourned where it becomes extremely important depending on the circumstances of each case or upon terms as the court may deem fit but the court has to be guided by the urgent nature of the application under the rules . By virtue of Order IV Rule 2 application for enforcement of fundamental rights is to be treated as an urgent matter and the court will not entertain or grant frivolous adjournments, except that which is extremely.</p>



<p><strong>Ex Parte application</strong></p>



<p>Because of the expedited nature of fundamental right enforcement applications, where a party desires interim orders on ex parte application, the court may only hear ex parte application on interim reliefs, where exceptional hardship will be done to the applicant especially when life or liberty of the applicant is involved – Order 4 r 3. The application ex parte is to be supported by affidavit, setting the grounds why delay in hearing the application would cause exceptional hardship – Order 4 r 4(a).</p>



<p><strong>Amendment and consolidation</strong></p>



<p>Amendment can only be permitted on the statement of facts alone, as further affidavit can deal with new issues in counter-affidavit Order 6 r 3. The amendment is by an application supported by an exhibit of the statement of facts to be amended. Order 6 r 3. The applicant upon the grant of the amendment is to amend within the time stated or apply for an extension, else such amendment would be deemed abandoned. Order 6 r 4.</p>



<p>By virtue of Order 7 r 2, the court is empowered to consolidate actions upon the application of the applicant where they are applications relating to infringement of a fundamental right(s) pending against several parties in respect of the same matter and on the same grounds and issues &#8211; Order 7 r 1,3</p>



<p>If the applications are before different judges, the applicant must apply to the chief judge to re-assign them to one of such judges</p>



<p><strong>Effect of non-compliance with rules</strong></p>



<p>Non-compliance shall be treated as an irregularity and not a nullity of such proceeding except if such non-compliance relates to the mode of commencement of the application, the subject matter is not within chapter IV of the CFRN or the African Charter on Human and Peoples Right (Ratification and Enforcement) Act &#8211; Order 9 r 1.</p>



<p><strong>Orders the court can make</strong></p>



<p>The court is empowered to make orders as it may consider just or appropriate. Such orders include orders contained in chapter IV CFRN, orders in the African Charter on Human and Peoples Right (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, and include damages, declaration, injunction, mandatory order, apology, interim orders as provided in Order 4 r 4, the grant of bail or order release of applicant from detention, production of the applicant on the date the matter is fixed for hearing if unlawful or wrongful detention is alleged, an injunction restraining respondent from acting (maintaining statute quo); other orders like access to counsel and family members; and mandatory order not to arrest again.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>From our discussion, it can be deduced that fundamental rights suits in Nigeria are special actions guided by separate rules. The rules governing the fundamental rights action make it expedient for courts to dispose of any fundamental rights action with the urgency they deserve since such lawsuits are intended to protect the constitutional rights of citizens.</p>



<p>However, it is noteworthy to state that a fundamental rights suit can be instituted in either State High Court, the Federal High Court, or the National Industrial Court depending on the circumstances of an individual case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>SUING A COMPANY IN NIGERIA</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW TO SUE A COMPANY</strong></p>
<p>An incorporated company has a separate entity distinct from the individuals who are shareholders and directors in control of the company’s operations. The procedure for how to sue a company is not far-fetched from the procedure for suing an ordinary person, because a company is also deemed as a legal personality with its own rights and privileges.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for bringing an action in Court against a Company. It could be as a result of a breach of contract, debt recovery, defective products, bad services, or injury to an individual or properties.</p>
<p>In detailing the procedure to sue a company in Nigeria, it is trite to first of all state that an incorporated company has the capacity to sue and be sued because it has the power of a natural person. It can institute an action to enforce its legal rights in its corporate name and also defend in its corporate name when sued.</p>
<p>A company may be liable in tort or breach of contract in respect of acts of its members or officers carried out on behalf of the company.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure for suing a company</strong></p>
<p>Where a company is being sued for monetary claims, the first step is to send a written demand notice drafted by a Lawyer to the company before an action can be brought against such a company. The demand notice usually explains the injuries suffered or the wrongs done by the complaint or particulars of any breach of contractual terms and the amount of compensation that the complainant or plaintiff is willing to collect. Such a letter may also be used to issue a warning to the company of the complainant&#8217;s intention of resorting to a court where the company refuses to comply with the demands in it.</p>
<p>For an action to be instituted, there must be a valid legal cause of action. This cause of action can be negligence suffered as a result of the company’s action or failure to act, breach of contract arising from an existing valid contract, employment discrimination arising from unlawful dismissal among others. A lawyer to weigh the scale of winning the suit must evaluate the cause of action before bringing an action in court; it should not be a frivolous matter based on emotions.</p>
<p>Where demand notice has been served on the company and it refuses to comply, the complainant can institute an action in court for the grievances suffered. An action can be brought in the jurisdiction where the company operates its business. If the company has an office in a state, it can be sued in that state.</p>
<p>The complaining party filing processes in court through a lawyer institutes an action. The processes may include a statement of claim, a list of witnesses to be relied on, witness statements on oath, and documents to be relied on during the trial of the case. These processes are further served on the Company effective by delivering the process in the company&#8217;s registered or corporate addresses or serving its directors or other principal officers of the company. Under the Nigerian law, no action may commence against a person or entity unless the party being sued has been duly served with a copy of the court’s processes detailing the case against him.</p>
<p>When an action has been duly filed in court, a suit number and court will be assigned to the matter and such matter will be listed on the court’s cause list.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, companies may prefer to settle matters that arise against it in an amicable way. In such a case, the alternative dispute resolution mechanism will be used to settle the matter. Mechanisms such as arbitration, mediation, reconciliation, or negotiation will be implemented for the timely settlement of the dispute.</p>
<p>It is also trite to state that there is a limitation period by the statute of limitations that can prevent an action to be instituted in court by a plaintiff. On that note the statute of limitations must be considered to ensure that the time limit for bringing an action against a company has not passed; limitation periods differ and usually dependent on the circumstance of the case and when the cause of action arose.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a company can be sued in its capacity because upon registration it becomes a legal personality that can sue or be sued. Various disputes that may arise between a company and an individual or between two corporate entities such as negligence, breach of contract, and among others can be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Before an action can be brought against a company, the cause of action must be genuine in order for the court to adjudicate on the matter. Nevertheless, most organizations or businesses prefer to settle matters amicably rather than resorting to court to protect the image of the company.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of a court is pertinent to be considered when suing a company, and a lawyer must be involved in the process of suing, from filing the court&#8217;s documents to the judgment.</p>
