										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Small businesses in Nigeria are liable for various tax obligations to various governments in Nigeria. It is important to know the taxes small businesses will be subjected to before commencing the operation of a small business in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Upon the registration of a business, such business is required to start remitting a certain amount of the profit derived from the business to the government. It is important to state that small businesses are not completely exempted from paying taxes although such businesses are exempted from paying company income taxes depending on the turnover of the company.</p>
<p><strong>Types of taxes to be paid by businesses in Nigeria </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Income Tax-</strong> all small business owners are liable to pay their personal income tax which is governed by the Personal Income Tax Act (Cap P8 LFN 2004), for each year of assessment from their source of income for the year, which also includes the profit made in the small business. It is paid as a direct assessment which is applicable to sole proprietors (small business) owners. The tax is paid from the income earned in the preceding year without notice or demand from the relevant tax authority. The deadline for remittance is the 31<sup>st</sup> of January of the succeeding year. Although the collection of this form of tax is the federal responsibility, it is however collected by the State government through the State Inland Revenue Service (SIRS).</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The schedule of chargeable income and the rate of tax to be paid by small business are as follows;</p>
<table style="margin-left: 40px;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="252">Annual Income</td>
<td width="204">Personal Income Tax Rate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="252">First N300,000.00</td>
<td width="204">7%</td>

<td width="204">11%</td>

<tr>
<td width="252">Next N500,000.00</td>
<td width="204">19%</td>

<tr>
<td width="252">Next N1,600,000.00</td>
<td width="204">21%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="252">Above N3,200,000.00</td>
<td width="204">24%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Company Income Tax-</strong> this form of tax is paid to the Federal government and it is imposed on the profits of companies incorporated in Nigeria. Although with the new Finance Act 2019, small businesses with an annual turnover of less than N25 Million are now completely exempted from paying company income tax. Hence, the company income tax rate for small businesses with a gross turnover of less than N25 Million Naira is 0%.</li>
<li><strong>Value Added Tax</strong>&#8211; small business owners are liable to remit the value-added tax (vat) also known as sales tax, which is imposed on the consumers of their goods and services to the State Inland Revenue Service. The tax is payable on the sales of specific goods and services rendered by small business owners. The tax rate payable on the purchase of certain goods and services is 7.5%.</li>
<li><strong>Withholding Tax</strong>&#8211; this is a tax paid from payments due to companies or individuals whether resident in Nigeria or not, that provides goods and services to individuals or companies in Nigeria. The period for filing withholding tax is on or before 21 days after the duty to deduct arose for deductions from companies. It is an advance payment of income tax.</li>
</ul>
<p>Withholding tax is charged at the rate of five percent (5%) or ten percent (10%) depending o the type of payment or nature of the transaction and also whether the beneficiary of the payment is an individual or a corporation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Premises Levies</strong>&#8211; this levy is a form of tax paid on property used for the production of income, office buildings, factories, etc paid to the State government. The tax rate paid is usually N10, 000 (Ten Thousand Naira) for registration and N5, 000 (Five Thousand Naira) for subsequent renewals in respect of urban and N2, 000 (Two Thousand Naira) in rural areas. This form of tax is paid in Lagos State to the Lagos Internal Revenue Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Small business owners are also required to register and obtain a Tax Identification Number (TIN) from the State Inland Revenue Service for the purpose of paying their relevant taxes. The TIN is simply an identification number unique to a business owner which is used in the administration of tax and making tax returns to the relevant authority.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Tax payment is important for the growth of a small business and ensuring tax compliance helps to secure the business and avoid any form of default and sanctions. Paying tax as a small business is also advantageous to the business owner as its evidence that the business is a committed one and it helps to also boost the reputation of the business owner especially when dealing with investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;">FIRS TAX CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE</h3>
<p>A Tax Clearance Certificate in Nigeria is basically a document stating that an entity does not owe tax for a period of time specified in the certificate. The tax clearance is a certificate of clearance, indicating one has been cleared for a period of time because it has paid its taxes if any. There are many uses of the Tax Clearance Certificate in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The body or agency of government responsible for issuing Tax Clearance in Nigeria is the <a href="https://www.firs.gov.ng/SiteApplication/Home/Home.aspx">Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS)</a> at the federal level for only companies; also the State Inland Revenue Services at the state levels for individuals.</p>
<h5><strong>APPLICATION FOR TAX CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE</strong></h5>
<p>Upon obtaining TIN, the company can now apply for the Tax Clearance Certificate by filling the tax clearance form which would be three. The applicant must fill the questionnaires with the FIRS for new taxpayers on the company’s letterhead, and this would be addressed to the tax controller accompanied by relevant documents.</p>
<p>The existing companies can only make an application for a Tax Clearance Certificate after the company’s audited report has been submitted and all outstanding taxes have been paid.</p>
<h5>WHO CAN OBTAIN A TAX CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE?</h5>
<p>A tax clearance certificate can be obtained by an individual or a company. A tax clearance certificate is issued in arrears over a course of three years. You need to have rendered your tax returns to the relevant authority over the course of three years to be eligible for a tax clearance certificate in Nigeria.</p>
<h5><strong>USAGES OF TAX CLEARANCE CERTIFICATES IN NIGERIA</strong></h5>
<p>Apart from the fact that the government clearly make use of  tax paid for the betterment of the society, such as provisions of good roads, and constant electricity, and also the fact that one can be punished for not paying tax under the law, there are several other benefits to be derived from paying taxes and obtaining Tax Clearance Certificate evidencing it, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>To apply for a trade license such as NUPRC &amp; NCC License</li>
<li>To apply for contracts from the government or agencies of the government and government-owned companies</li>
<li>To process an import or export license</li>
<li>For the processing of a gaming license</li>
<li>Usually required to stand as a surety for a person on bail</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>It is important to state further that all FIRS&#8217;s Tax Clearance Certificates in Nigeria are issued to cover arrears of three taxable years. The fact that a company is new does not exempt such a company from obtaining a Tax Clearance Certificate. In such a circumstance, the Tax Clearance Certificate will clearly indicate “NIL”, which implies such a company does not own taxes for the period before its formation.</p>
<p>The TCC is issued by FIRS for companies, while the States Internal Revenue Services issue similar Tax Clearance for individual taxpayers within their respective states.</p>

<h3 class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><strong>VAT IN NIGERIA</strong></h3>



<p>The Value Added Tax in Nigeria is the tax payable on goods and services consumed by any person, whether government agencies, business organization, or individuals. It can also be said to be a tax on spending or consumption levied at every stage of transaction but eventually borne by the final consumer of such goods and services.</p>



<p>Section 7 of the Valued Added Tax Act vests power of administration of <a href="https://www.firs.gov.ng/SiteApplication/Home/Home.aspx">VAT in the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS),</a> which acts as a Federal Tax Agency. The VAT is charged on most goods and services provided in Nigeria and also on goods imported into Nigeria.</p>



<p>Businesses add VAT to the sales price of the goods or services they offer in Nigeria and the tax is borne by the final consumer of goods and services because it is included in the tax paid. VAT is currently calculated at a flat rate of 7.5% of the cost of services and products and is charged on a wide array of goods and services.  </p>



<p>Section 8 sub 1 of the VAT Act states that businesses are expected to register for VAT within the first six months of the start of the business. Businesses that want to do business with state, federal, or local government agencies are also required to show evidence of registration with VAT and past remittance. The registered person has to make regular VAT returns and either pays to or receives from the FIRS the difference of the input tax and the output tax. VAT returns are normally made monthly to the FIRS tax office.</p>



<p><strong>SCOPE OF THE VAT ACT</strong></p>



<p>The VAT Act under section 10 sub 1 also requires Non-resident companies to register with the VAT office using the address of the person or business that it is doing business within Nigeria. Correspondence related to VAT for this business will be sent to this address. A non-resident company is also required to include VAT in the invoices to the person or business it is doing business within Nigeria and the VAT is to be remitted in the currency of the contract. It is also to be noted that the VAT system in Nigeria has an in-built refund or credit mechanism, which eliminates the cascading effect.</p>



<p><strong>HOW TO CALCULATE VAT</strong></p>



<p>VAT is calculated at a flat rate of 7.5% on all goods and services sold in Nigeria; this is stipulated under section 4 of the VAT Act, except items that are on the VAT exempt list or zero-rated. An example of such is exported goods, all exported goods are zero-rated, that is such goods are VAT-able but at zero percent. This means that VAT is collected from the foreign buyer and at the same time any input tax is refundable.</p>



<p>Businesses are required to calculate the amount of VAT they received from customers in a month and offset that with the VAT they paid to suppliers for goods and services. If the amount of VAT paid is more than the VAT the business collected, then the business is owed a refund. If the amount paid is less than the VAT the business collected, the business must remit the difference. Note, only goods purchased or imported directly for resale and goods used for the direct production of any new product on which the output tax is charged can be used to calculate the offsetting tax. The VAT on overhead, services, and general expenses cannot be used to calculate the offsetting VAT. These expenses are expected to be deducted before arriving at taxable profits and so do not qualify.</p>



<p>A business is expected under section 15 sub 1 to remit VAT it has collected by the 30th day of the month following the month the goods or services were sold. For example, if a business sells a product on March 15th, VAT on the sale must be submitted by April 30th of the same year to avoid any penalties. The penalty for non-remittance of VAT to the FIRS is N5, 000 per month for every month that the amount is past due. Although VAT is a multiple-stage tax, it has a single effect and does not add more than the specified rate to the consumer price no matter the number of stages at which the tax is paid.</p>



<p><strong>GOODS AND SERVICES EXEMPTED FROM VAT</strong></p>



<p>There are some goods in Nigeria, which are specifically exempted from paying VAT as contained in the first schedule of the VAT Act, and such include medical and pharmaceutical products; basic food items; books and educational material; newspapers and magazines; baby products; commercial vehicles and their spare parts; agricultural equipment and products; and veterinary medicine.</p>



<p>Finally, to claim a credit for input VAT, a registered person must hold a tax invoice, also records and accounts have to be kept to aid VAT administration.</p>
