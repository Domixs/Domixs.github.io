										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Money laundering is the process of concealing the origin of money, obtained from illicit activities such as drug trafficking, corruption, and embezzlement by converting it into a legitimate source. It is a crime in many jurisdictions with varying definitions. It is usually a key operation of organized crime.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, the Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act of 2022 was passed into Law in the month of May 2022 to set standards and promote the effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering. The new Act has made an improvement on the earlier Act of 2011.</p>
<p>In this write-up, we shall briefly discuss the relevant provisions of the new Act below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Limit</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Section 2 of the Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022 provides;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>(1) No person or body corporate shall, except in a transaction through a financial institution, make or accept cash payment of a sum exceeding— </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(a) N5,000,000 or its equivalent, in the case of an individual; or </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(b) N10,000,000 or its equivalent, in the case of a body corporate. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(2) A person shall not conduct two or more transactions separately with one or more financial institutions or designated non-financial businesses and professions with intent to— </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(a) avoid the duty to report a transaction which should be reported under this Act; and </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(b) breach the duty to disclose information under this act by any other means. </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li> As seen from the provision above, the cash limit permissible for an individual to make or accept is the sum of N5,000,000(Five Million Naira) or its equivalent and N10,000,000(Ten Million Naira) or its equivalent in the case of a body corporate. Such transactions are to be routed through a financial institution, and any lodgment of funds in excess of N5,000,000 (Five Million Naira) and N10,000,000(Ten Million Naira) for individuals and body corporate respectively, must be reported by the banks within seven days.</li>
<li><strong>Splits</strong>: Subsection 2 above prohibits a situation where a person splits a single transaction into two or more separate transactions with the intent to avoid the reporting of such transaction.</li>
<li>Section 3 of the Act provides that the international transfer of funds or securities to or from a foreign country exceeding $10,000(Ten Thousand Dollars) is to be reported within one day of the transaction. Funds refer to assets of every kind whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, howsoever acquired and legal documents or instruments in any form, including electronic or digital, evidencing title to or interest in such assets, including bank credits, travellers’ cheques, bank cheques, money orders, shares, securities, bonds, drafts or letters of credit and virtual assets. Virtual assets, on the other hand, mean a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or investment purposes but do not include digital representations of fiat currencies, securities and other financial assets.</li>
<li><strong>Know Your Customer (KYC):</strong> For the purpose of carrying out the purport of this law, in Section 4 of the Act, financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions must conduct due diligence and identification of their customers particularly persons alleging to act on behalf of its customers. Designated non-financial businesses and professions include (a) automotive dealers, (b) businesses involved in the hospitality industry, (c) casinos, (d) clearing and settlement companies, (e) consultants and consulting companies, (f ) dealers in jewelries, (g) dealers in mechanised farming equipment, farming equipment and machineries, (h) dealers in precious metals and precious stones, (i) dealers in real estate, estate developers, estate agents and brokers (j) high value dealers, (k) hotels, (l) legal practitioners and notaries, (m) licensed professional accountants, (n) mortgage brokers, (o) practitioners of mechanised farming, (p) supermarkets, (q) tax consultants, (r) trust and company service providers, (s) pools betting, or (t) such other businesses and professions as may be designated by the Minister responsible for Trade and Investment.</li>
<li>The law provides for 24-hour timeframes for all financial institutions or designates non-financial institutions to file suspicious transaction reports with the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) which is the central unit responsible for receiving, requesting, analyzing and disseminating to the competent authorities disclosures of financial information concerning the suspected proceeds of crime and potential financing of terrorism. With regards to this reporting, section 7 provides thus:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Where a transaction— (a) involves a frequency which is unjustifiable or unreasonable, (b) is surrounded by conditions of unusual or unjustified complexity, (c) appears to have no economic justification or lawful objective, (d) is inconsistent with the known transaction pattern of the account or business relationship, or (e) in the opinion of the financial institution or non-financial business and profession involves the proceeds of a criminal activity, unlawful act, money laundering or terrorist financing, that transaction shall be deemed to be suspicious and the financial institution and designated non-financial business and profession involved in the transaction shall report to the Unit as the case may be immediately. (2) A financial institution or designated non-financial business and profession shall within 24 hours after the transaction referred to in subsection (1).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Act further spells out the punishment for failure to report and/or make a disclosure of acts of money laundering. Section 11 of the Act provides that any financial institution or designated non-financial business and profession that contravenes the provisions commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of at least N250,000 and not more than N1,000,000 for each day the contravention continues. Also, Legal professional privilege and the invocation of client confidentiality shall not apply in connection with— (a) the purchase or sale of property; (b) the purchase or sale of any business; (c) the managing of client money, securities or other assets; (d) the opening or management of bank, savings or securities accounts; (d) the creation, operation or management of trusts, companies or similar structures; or (e) anything produced in furtherance of any unlawful act.</li>
<li>The law prohibits the opening or maintaining of numbered or anonymous accounts by any person, financial institution or body corporate. The operation of and establishment of a shell bank in Nigeria is also prohibited. A shell bank means a bank that is not physically located in the country in which it is incorporated and licensed, and which is unaffiliated with a regulated financial group that is subject to effective consolidated supervision. Any person, financial institution or body corporate that contravenes the provisions commits an offence and is liable to conviction to, in the case of an individual, a term of imprisonment of at least two years but not more than five years or in the case of a financial institution or body corporate, a fine of at least N10,000,000 but not more than N50,000,000, in addition, there shall be the prosecution of the principal officers of the body corporate and the winding up and prohibition of its constitution or incorporation under any form or guise.</li>
<li>Furthermore, financial institutions and non-designated financial businesses and professions must create mechanisms for determining whether a customer or a customer’s beneficiary is a politically exposed person. The Act defines politically exposed persons to include (a) individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example Heads of State or Government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of State-owned corporations and important political party officials, (b) individuals who are or have been entrusted domestically with prominent public functions, for example Heads of State or of Government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of State-owned corporations and important political party officials, and (c) persons who are or have been entrusted with a prominent function by an international organisation and includes members of senior management such as directors, deputy directors and members of the board or equivalent functions and their family members and close associates, other than middle ranking or more junior individuals in the foregoing categories.</li>
<li><strong>Registration with SCUML:</strong> The new Act makes it mandatory for all non-designated financial institutions to register with the SCUML and make various statutory reports as provided by the Act.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>CONCLUSION </u></strong></p>
<p>Conclusively, the new Act seeks to remedy the lacuna that the former Act created. Based on the key provisions above, an individual and body corporate who makes or accepts transactions exceeding the amount stipulated in the Act commits an offence and is liable to punishment as prescribed.</p>
<p>The Act further seeks to put financial institutions on their feet in the discharge of their duties by placing a timeframe within which to report any suspicious transactions and failure to do so attracts a penalty as discussed above.</p>
<p>It suffices to say that the new Act does not encourage lackadaisical attitudes from persons or corporate bodies involved in any financial transaction.</p>

<p>Malicious prosecution could be defined as a tort arising from unsuccessful criminal or civil proceedings instituted against another party with malice and without probable or reasonable cause. It is also defined as the tort of initiating criminal prosecution or civil suit against another party with malice and without probable cause. Where any person has been maliciously prosecuted, such person may bring an action in tort seeking damages against the accusers. The case of <strong>OGBONNA v. OGBONNA &amp; ANOR (2014) LPELR-22308(CA) </strong>was instructive on it.</p>
<p>Malicious prosecutions are outright abuse of process and usually damage to the character, person, liberty, property or finance. In the circumstance, the Plaintiff would have illegitimately used the coercive powers of the state to cause harm to another, the Defendant and the coercive powers of the state are, thus, also abused.</p>
<p>For a claimant to succeed in an action for malicious prosecution, he or she must plead and prove the followings;</p>
<ol>
<li>The prosecution proceedings (normally criminal) were initiated by the prosecutor against the plaintiff;</li>
<li>Termination of the prosecution proceedings was in the plaintiff&#8217;s favour;</li>
<li>No reasonable or probable cause for the prosecution;</li>
<li>Evidence of malice on the prosecutor&#8217;s part; and</li>
<li>That the plaintiff suffered actual damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the case of <strong>EJIKEME V. NWOSU (2002) 3 NWLR (Pt. 754) 356; (2001) LPELR CA/J/76/94</strong></p>
<p>The onus is on the plaintiff to prove each of the elements stated above.</p>
<p><strong>PROCEEDING WAS INSTITUTED BY THE DEFENDANT</strong></p>
<p>For the claim for malicious prosecution, to be liable, a defendant must be actively instrumental in setting the law in motion for the prosecution of the plaintiff.”</p>
<p><strong>In the words of ELECHI  J.C.A  </strong>in <strong>ADEBOWALE v. ROBINSON (2018) LPELR-44424(CA), </strong>” <strong><em>an action for malicious prosecution will not lie against a person who merely gave an information to the police by a report or complaint of the commission of an offence which led the police on their own initiative to arrest, and eventually charge another to Court after their investigation of the complaint</em></strong>” see also the case of  <strong>INNEH V. ARUEGBON (1952) 14 WACA 73,</strong></p>
<p>Thus, If the evidence did not show that the defendant influenced the police in any way in the decision to prosecute a plaintiff, then the prosecution cannot and will not properly be attributable to the defendant, but the police.</p>
<p>Witnesses are immune from an action in malicious prosecution even if they lie on the witness box. This is because an action for malicious prosecution focuses on the abuse of the legal process, not on defamatory or untruthful statements.</p>
<p><strong>TERMINATION OF THE PROSECUTION PROCEEDINGS WAS IN THE PLAINTIFF&#8217;S FAVOUR;</strong></p>
<p>The action for Malicious prosecution will fail if the criminal proceeding was not determined in favour of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>In <strong>FADEYI &amp; ANOR V. OWOLABI &amp; ANOR (2014) LPELR- 22475 (CA),</strong> where the Appellants were discharged and acquitted on the count at the trial court. The Court of Appeal held that for an action on malicious prosecution to fail, it should be shown that the trial ended in the conviction of the accused.</p>
<p>Where in the criminal proceeding instituted against the plaintiff, a <strong><em>nolle prosequi</em></strong> (prosecutor discontinues prosecution) is entered on behalf of the plaintiff, the plaintiff does not need to positively prove his innocence to recover damages for malicious prosecution as held in the case of  OGBONNA V. OGBONNA &amp;ANOR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROBABLE CAUSE </strong></p>
<p>The plaintiff must prove that there was no reasonable cause for the prosecution and was instituted for an improper purpose. See <strong>GARBA V. MAIGORO (1992) 5 NWLR (Pt.243) 588. </strong>It is however for the plaintiff to establish a lack of reasonable and probable cause not for the defendant to prove its existence.</p>
<p>A failure to fully investigate the facts surrounding a case may be sufficient to prove a lack of probable cause.</p>
<p><strong>DAMAGES</strong></p>
<p>The plaintiff must prove that by the prosecution against him he suffered damages either to his reputation, person or property. He must satisfy the court either that he was corporally punished or imprisoned or that he had been in jeopardy of such punishment or that he incurred cost in the course of the prosecution.</p>
<p>In Conclusion, malicious prosecution entails actions against a defendant who without reasonable or probable cause initiates criminal prosecution against the plaintiff which terminates in the plaintiff’s favour and which also results in damages either to the plaintiff’s reputation, person or property. A person suing for malicious prosecution must prove all of the above elements stipulated in the case <strong>EJIKEME V. NWOSU</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> MONEY LAUNDERING CASES IN NIGERIA</strong></p>
<p>Money laundering is the process of concealing the origins of illegally obtained money, typically by means of transfers through a legitimate business. The principal law governing money laundering in Nigeria is the <strong>Money Laundering Prohibition Act (2011). </strong>The leading government agency investigating and prosecuting the offenses of money laundering in Nigeria is the <a href="https://efccnigeria.org/efcc/">Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).</a></p>
<p>There are several notable money laundering cases in Nigeria.</p>
<p>In the case of<strong> <em>UDE JONES UDEOGU V. FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA &amp; ORS (2016) LPELR-40102(SC), </em></strong>the issue arose when the Ude Jones Udeogu, Orji Uzor Kalu, Slok Nigeria were all arraigned before the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja. This arraignment occurred in the year 2005 when some indigenes of Abia State wrote a petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) against Orji Uzor Kalu, the 2nd Respondent herein, who was then the Governor of Abia State.</p>
<p>After an investigation was carried out by EFCC, there was evidence to show that the then Governor of Abia State had carried out some shady dealings with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Respondent, Slok Nig. Ltd. It was alleged that Mr. Orji Kalu had gone ahead to withdraw several billion on Naira which belonged to the State and converted the same into various bank drafts and lodged the same in the account of Slok Nig. Ltd.  In the circumstance, the 1st Respondent filed a criminal charge against the Appellant and the 3rd Respondent.</p>
<p>The Appellant and the 3rd Respondent filed a joint application on 11th July 2008, wherein they sought for an order quashing the charges preferred against them. The learned trial Judge dismissed the application to quash the charges brought before the court.</p>
<p>The Appellant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Respondents relied on Section 14(1) (a) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act 2004 under which the charge was brought that provides and follows:-</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;14. (1) any person who-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>converts, or transfer resources or properties derived directly or indirectly from illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances or any other crime or illegal act, with the aim of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the resources or properties or aiding any person involved in the illicit traffic in narcotic drug or psychotropic substances or any other crime or illegal act to avoid the illegal consequences of his action commits an offence under this section and it liable on conviction to a term of not less than 2 years or more than 3 years.&#8221;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Supreme Court went ahead to provide the ingredients of money laundering by stating as argued by the Learned Counsel to the Respondent as follows:</p>
<p>(i) The accused converted or transferred resources or property;</p>
<p>(ii) The resources or property must have been derived directly or indirectly from drug-related offenses or any other crimes or illegal acts:</p>
<p>(iii) The conversion or transfer of the resources must be with the aim:</p>
<p>(a) Concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the resources or property; or</p>
<p>(b) Aiding any person involved in any of the acts of drug-related offenses or any other crime or illegal act so as to evade the illegal consequences of his action.</p>
<p>The Court, in this case, concluded and further held that:</p>
<p><em><strong>“In the case at hand, the funds allegedly transferred by the Appellant were funds originally in the account of the Abia State Government meant for the development of that state. It was alleged that the funds were later withdrawn illegally from the Government&#8217;s Account on the pretence that these were for an official purpose, but in fact, the money withdrawn in cash was used to purchase bank drafts and the said drafts were later traced to the Appellant&#8217;s Account and were subsequently paid into the account of the 3rd Respondent. Clearly the circumstance in which the withdrawals of this money were made requires some explanation from the Appellant about his involvement”</strong></em></p>
<p>The criminal trial was later continued at the Federal High Court. Upon the conclusion of the trial, the defendants were all found guilty of the offenses preferred against them by the prosecution.</p>
<p>However, all the accused were later discharged by the Supreme Court on the ground that the Judge who heard and delivered judgment in respect of the criminal case has been elevated to the Court of Appeal as at the time he delivered the judgment, and thereby lacked the jurisdiction to still preside on such a case and deliver judgment. All the accused are to be re-arraigned as ordered by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In the case of <strong><em>EFCC V DR. MARTINS OLUWAFEMI THOMAS, (2018) LPELR-45547(CA)</em>, </strong>the sum of $2,198,900.00 was found in the possession of Ibiteye John Bamidele. Being such a huge sum of money, the said man was arrested at the local wing of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport while trying to board a flight to Abuja. When investigations commenced, the Respondent, Dr Martins Oluwafemi Thomas came to lay claim on the money and said he gave the money to John Bamidele to take it to Abuja. He made a statement and he was later granted administrative bail. He was asked to deposit his international passport. Several days later, the Respondent filed an application before the Federal High Court seeking the under listed reliefs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A declaration that the sum and his international passport seized is illegal and ultra vires the powers of the EFCC.</li>
<li>A declaration that the EFCC had no right to arrest or detain or declare the applicant as a wanted person</li>
<li>A declaration that the EFCC has no right to restrict the applicant’s movement in or outside Nigeria on the basis of the unlawful seizure of the Applicant’s money in the sum of $2,200,000.00</li>
<li>A declaration that the EFCC was in breach of the applicant’s fundamental human rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>The application was opposed by the Appellant and upon due consideration by the Federal High Court, the trial Court granted the reliefs. On appeal, the EFCC argued that the lower court failed to take into consideration the investigations carried on by the Appellant in ascertaining the offense of money laundering which involves disguising or concealing the illicit origin of wealth. The Appellant argued that there was a prima facie case against the Respondent alleging that the Respondent gave the huge sum of cash to the said Bamidele without passing the same through a financial institution, which was in contravention to Section 1 of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011. However, the Court of Appeal held that the appeal lacked merit and therefore the appeal failed.</p>
<p>In this case of <strong>OYEBODE ALADE ATOYEBI V. FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA (2017) LPELR-43831(SC), </strong>Mr Alade Atoyebi alongside one other person were arraigned before the trial Court on a 54 count charge wherein they were accused of the offense of money laundering. The accused now appellant was charged for accepting cash payments from the Lagos State House of Assembly which was above the specified amount allowed under the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, without going through a financial institution The accused now appellant made an application for no-case submission at the trial court and same was upheld by the court. The state appealed against the decision of the trial court to the court of appeal where it was held that there was indeed a good case made against the accused persons and this position was also upheld at the supreme court of Nigeria.</p>
<p><strong>DEFENCES TO MONEY LAUNDERING CHARGES</strong></p>
<p>Money Laundering is considered a very serious offense, and anyone caught engaging in such an offense will be prosecuted accordingly. However, there are several defenses to money laundering offense recognized under the law, but we shall briefly explain the two major defenses below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ABSENCE OF INTENTION</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The intent to commit a crime known as “mens rea” in law must be present before any person can be convicted of an offense of money laundering. If the Defendant can prove he or she is unaware of the money that was obtained is illegitimate, then such a person may lack the requisite mens rea required for the commissioning of the crime.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is applicable where the prosecution failed to prove the ingredients of the money laundering offense. In the case of <strong><em>Ude Jones Udeogu V. Federal Republic Of Nigeria &amp; Ors (2016) Lpelr-40102(Sc)</em></strong>(Supra) the Supreme Court listed the ingredients of a money laundering offense. The prosecution must prove all these ingredients of the charges beyond reasonable doubt for there to be any conviction. Where the prosecution failed to prove the ingredients of a money laundering offense, such charges are liable to be dismissed by the court.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important for business people and individuals to regularly consult with lawyers or be familiar with the provisions of the Money laundering Act (2011) to ascertain what acts or financial transactions may lead to money laundering offenses, as ignorant of the law is not an excuse. For instance, pursuant to the provisions of Section 10 of the Money Laundering Act (Prohibition) Act, a Financial Institutions or Desgnatated Non-Financial Institutions must report within 7 to 30 days any single lodgement of more than N5,0000,000 or its equivalent in case of an individual or N10,000,000 or its equivalent in the case of a body corporate to the Special Control Unit Against Money Laundering (SCUML).</p>
